title: "Building an Animation Pipeline"
description: |
  We do a lot of work with Excalidraw, and this session shows the AI-first workflow
  for turning any sketch into a finished animation.
  We'll blend Claude Code with custom TypeScript scripts, wire up interactive slash commands,
  and add browser automation to existing OSS tools to export polished WebM assets.
