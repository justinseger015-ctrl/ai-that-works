## Overview

This episode explores a complete AI-assisted animation workflow:

- **Excalidraw + excalidraw-animate**: Using a fork of the open source excalidraw-animate project to generate WebM animations from Excalidraw drawings
- **Claude Code automation**: Custom slash commands that let Claude handle the entire pipeline - from reading the Excalidraw file to uploading the final video to YouTube
- **Browser automation**: Headless browser techniques for recording animations without manual intervention
- **Research/Plan/Implement workflow**: Live demonstration of using AI to build and extend the animation toolchain

## Key Takeaways

- The value of Claude Code isn't just automation - it's abstracting away the "glue work" of passing file paths and parameters between tools
- Sometimes burning tokens is worth it vs. writing a bash script, because Claude can adapt the workflow on the fly ("make it slower")
- Parallelizing AI coding tasks requires focus - realistically 2 tasks in parallel for deep work, maybe 4 if you're fully locked in
- Don't outsource the thinking - AI reads and writes code fast, but the quality depends on your engagement and design decisions
