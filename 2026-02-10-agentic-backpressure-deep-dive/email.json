  "body": "Hello First Name,\n\nOur latest \ud83e\udd84 ai that works session was all about making AI coding more reliable with \"Learning Tests & Proof-Driven Development\"!\n\nYou can find the full recording, code, and diagrams from the session right here on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/hellovai/ai-that-works\n\nWe talked a lot about how to get better results from your AI coding agents by checking your assumptions early on with learning tests and proof-driven development. Here's a quick recap:\n\n- **Learning Tests for Black Boxes:** When you're working with external APIs, CLIs, or systems where you can't see the code, just reading the docs isn't always enough. We showed how to write small \"learning tests\" (like quick PoC programs or unit tests) to actually *poke* the system and confirm how it *really* behaves, not just what the documentation claims.\n- **Proof-Driven Development:** Think of these learning tests as your secret weapon! They help you *prove* your assumptions about external systems *before* you start building anything big. This way, you catch misunderstandings early, saving you a ton of time and effort later.\n- **Letting AI Help Itself:** The coolest part? You can actually get your coding agent (like Claude Code) to *generate* these learning tests, run them, and then update its own understanding based on the results. This creates a clear feedback loop, helping the AI correct itself and validate what it thinks it knows, without you having to constantly step in.\n\nIf there's one key takeaway from this session:\nThe best way to get better code from your AI agent (especially when it's dealing with external systems) is to set up clear feedback loops, like learning tests. This lets the AI check its own assumptions and fix mistakes *before* you even look at the code, saving you a ton of your time and effort.\n\nOur next session tomorrow is all about \"Building an AI Content Pipeline\" \u2013 we'll show you how we use AI to generate content for the show, including clip selections and highlight reels. Kevin will be joining us for this one!\nSign up here: https://lu.ma/zcf5c8yd\nGot questions? Just reply to this email or hop into our Discord: https://www.boundaryml.com/discord. We read every message! Happy coding \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\n\nVaibhav & Dex",
