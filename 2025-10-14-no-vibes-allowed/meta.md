title: "No Vibes Allowed - Live Coding with AI Agents"
description: |
  Vaibhav Gupta and Dex demonstrate the power of AI-assisted coding by implementing a complex timeout feature for BAML (a programming language for AI applications) in a live coding session. Starting from a GitHub issue that had been open since March, they showcase a systematic workflow: specification refinement, codebase research, implementation planning, and phased execution. Using Claude and specialized coding agents, they navigate a 400,000+ line codebase, implementing timeout configurations for HTTP clients including connection timeouts, request timeouts, idle timeouts, and time-to-first-token for streaming responses. The session highlights key practices like context engineering, frequent plan validation, breaking complex features into testable phases, and the importance of reading AI-generated code. In under 3 hours of live coding, they achieve what would typically take 1-2 days of engineering time, successfully implementing parsing, validation, error handling, and Python integration tests.
