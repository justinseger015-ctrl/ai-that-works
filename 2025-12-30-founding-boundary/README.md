## Overview

A candid conversation about Vaibhav's path to founding Boundary and creating BAML:

- **Early builder**: From Yu-Gi-Oh inspired card games to convincing parents to invest in cruise ships
- **Learning to code**: PHP and SVN with a friend, selling software to his boarding school
- **The grind**: Writing 50-100k lines of code per year in college, skipping classes to build
- **FAANG to founder**: Microsoft, Google, and the leap to YC
- **12 pivots**: The winding road to BAML and building the programming language for AI

## Key Takeaways

- PHP is awful, C is beautiful (hot take)
- Convincing people to install hardware on their doors is hard
- The best way to learn a codebase: plumbing tasks that go end-to-end through the compiler
- Sometimes you just love building - code is just the medium
