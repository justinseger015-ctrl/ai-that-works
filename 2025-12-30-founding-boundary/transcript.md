Dex (roastmaster General) (00:00.296)
Alright, alright, we are live. We are ready. Are y'all ready?

Vaibhav (00:07.506)
No. Let's go.

Dex (roastmaster General) (00:07.63)
I can't hear the chat. There's no live audience. We're gonna get a live audience from one of these.

Vaibhav (00:11.782)
Dude, that would be kind of fun.

Dex (roastmaster General) (00:14.75)
How you doing dude? You have a good holiday?

Vaibhav (00:16.428)
I had actually a wonderful break. think I took some actual time off, which is really, really nice.

Dex (roastmaster General) (00:23.126)
You told me we talked the day before Christmas Eve and I was like, are you taking some time off? And you're like, no, I'm just going to code all day on Christmas Eve and all day on Christmas Day. It's going to be awesome. Did you not? Did that not end up happening? Did you get talked out of that?

Vaibhav (00:34.012)
So yes, Christmas day, actually didn't end up coding. I only coded at night. During the day, actually hung out with friends, invited some of the team over, invited some friends over, and we had a really, really fun time.

Dex (roastmaster General) (00:46.126)
I guess we should do intros. I'm Dex. I'm the founder of HumanLayer. We make tools to help you use coding agents better. This is AI That Works podcast. We're doing something a little bit different today. Here, Vibe, I'll let you introduce yourself and then I'll let you, I will tell people what we're doing today.

Vaibhav (01:02.61)
I'm Vive off. work on BAML along with my co-founder Aaron, and we build the programming language.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:08.216)
Amazing. and today we are going to dive deep, rather than going hardcore into AI programming concepts and AI engineering concepts, we're actually just going to go deep on Vibe off story and hear a little bit about what it was like. I heard there was about 12 pivots or something. last week we did this with me and we ended up talking about AI engineering for like half the time anyway. So I'm sure you'll still get some good content and some good riffs and some hot takes. but, yeah, is, is Aaron joining today or is it just you?

Vaibhav (01:37.458)
Let me, think he was supposed to, but I think I forgot to send him a calendar invite. Let me ping him really fast on Slack. And then while we do that, general. We had a pretty big customer start using BAML and it was very like over the holidays, I guess. And let's just say Aaron has been on it. But let me, yeah, let me send him a link really fast and then he can join as well. think he will, he will give a.

Dex (roastmaster General) (02:00.27)
who's been on it.

Vaibhav (02:06.849)
much more interesting perspective.

Dex (roastmaster General) (02:10.35)
Cool. mean we can get started. I mean, I'm curious, you you've done a ton of stuff Before starting BAML and I'm curious like I would love to just kind of hear a little bit of like when Everybody has a moment where they're like exploring what they want to do and then they do something and they are like, okay This is a thing I want to double down on and like I can talk about my moment for CS and programming with that but like I'm curious to know like

Vaibhav (02:19.931)
Yeah.

Dex (roastmaster General) (02:38.424)
Did you know you wanted to do CS in programming when you got to college? Did you decide that in the middle of some internship during college? Was it when you were at Microsoft or Google? So this is the pivot story. This is like founding BAML. I can see this. I want to actually start a little bit earlier.

Vaibhav (02:56.463)
Yeah, so we'll talk about this, but we'll talk about before. let's talk about, let's talk about before. I think for me, I, I always liked coding. I think there's a time, not coding actually, I guess, I guess I go like building. I think there's a time in like call in like seventh grade or something where I tried making a multiplayer card game, like a trading card game because like Yu-Gi-Oh! is popular. I should try and build my own and make it even more popular. I made a pitch deck.

Dex (roastmaster General) (03:18.124)
like writing the cards by hand or like printing them out. Yeah.

Vaibhav (03:20.567)
Literally, tried making my own card deck and making like a mechanic around them that would make it like, like it was called the age of history or something. It was like based off like real world. I had sentries from like all sorts of historical armies and everything. think age of war. then I.

Dex (roastmaster General) (03:32.746)
Okay, and then you tried to balance a game and you realize how freaking hard that was.

Vaibhav (03:37.328)
It turned out seventh grader me could not do that. I tried doing, I remember writing a memorandum to my parents about like why we should invest in a cruise ship and why we should build a cruise ship. Turns out cruise ships are really expensive. And I did not rationalize that at that time, but it was a good business idea is what I would say. I did a bunch of other silly ideas.

Dex (roastmaster General) (03:53.762)
Ha

Vaibhav (04:00.753)
But some container ships, yes, sadly I didn't know about B2B SaaS, Maseo, about container ships at that time. But I think I just like building and creating things for a long time. It was like a passion of mine. And then sometime around like very, very late high school, sadly not before college applications. I learned a lot about like coding. One of my friends just sat me down. I had this stupid idea one day at lunch. We went back to the dorm. I went to boarding school.

We went back to the dorms and he just started creating it. He was like, I can build that. And I literally sat next to him, watched him write some stupid PHP on his computer. We made a lamp stack for those who are familiar with that. And I was there like being like, what does that do? What does that do? And I think at some point he just got annoyed of me asking him all these things. And he'd be like, he'd just send me off and say like, go add this thing in there, go add this thing in there. And we use SVN and everything back in the day, not even Git.

Dex (roastmaster General) (04:36.556)
Mm-hmm.

Dex (roastmaster General) (04:50.861)
Okay.

I had to use, so SVN was invented at University of Chicago. And so even though Git had been around forever, when we learned version control, they changed this right after I left. They changed the physics program to use Python instead of this spreadsheet thing called Kalydigraph. And they changed all the CS classes to use Git instead of Subversion. I just missed it. Yeah, SVN's crazy. Sorry about that, man.

Vaibhav (04:57.965)
that's wild.

Vaibhav (05:13.071)
Yeah. yeah, was what, but I mean, that's all I knew though. I didn't know anything different. and then we did that. No, I, no, not really. I didn't know any better. I just, my friend was really smart. So just did what he told me to do. I didn't really make opinions at that time. so I think that was like the first time I really started writing some code and then I kind of got more into it. I like, I caught myself C that was the first real programming language I actually learned. and then.

Dex (roastmaster General) (05:20.13)
But you knew it sucked. Even if you knew nothing else, you were like, I hate this. No? OK.

Dex (roastmaster General) (05:31.447)
Okay.

Dex (roastmaster General) (05:41.356)
What did you want to build with C? What was like the first thing you made?

Vaibhav (05:45.265)
Well, first that software, that stupid software we were building on the PHP stack, we actually convinced our school to buy it, which was awesome. Yeah, we convinced our school to buy it. They tried it for like a small fee. Every student in the school used it. And I was hooked from that point onwards. And then I started doing like a bunch of like side apps on the side. And that's when I started learning C. I was doing some like, I think like back then I was like, oh, I should do some research because like that's what every other kid in my school did. They did research. And then I did.

Dex (roastmaster General) (05:50.285)
Yeah.

cool.

Dex (roastmaster General) (06:13.472)
Okay.

Vaibhav (06:15.088)
So I did like some material science, neural network research back then. And I was trying to build my own neural network stuff. And like the way to do that, it was C. So I did C. And that was kind of why I learned it. I wrote my own thing. It didn't really work, but the weights did propagate and they did stuff. The data just looking good enough. And from there, I just wrote a lot more code. And then I got into embedded systems a lot more. I started doing robotics, started building also some other things in college.

Dex (roastmaster General) (06:34.327)
Yeah.

Vaibhav (06:43.6)
And I just love building. I really have no other way to describe it. Like code was just fun. I think at some point it looked good. I was going to say at some point I looked at some point I looked back at the like random code I had at one point. I think I wrote like around 50 to a hundred thousand out of the code a year in college. And I did that almost consistently. And it was so much fun. Like I would

Dex (roastmaster General) (06:48.386)
making things. was actually also... Sorry, go ahead. I have one small tangent,

Dex (roastmaster General) (07:08.194)
just always doing it, learning, making something.

Vaibhav (07:10.544)
I would hang out with my friends all day long, skip every single class and just write code. And it didn't matter what I wrote. I wrote like this thing where like, I hated unlocking my door because I hate carrying my keys. Uh, so I built a thing that would detect when I came nearby, I would unlock my door and then I made an idea for how I can build a Bluetooth. Yeah, exactly. Then I was like, oh shit, this too power hungry because it's very power hungry. So then I tried to do something else where I was like, oh, what if we build a Bluetooth mesh network?

Dex (roastmaster General) (07:24.558)
With your phone like Bluetooth or what?

Dex (roastmaster General) (07:32.418)
That's like, yeah.

Vaibhav (07:36.464)
where every single door in the campus had it so that we could use Bluetooth low energy to go do that. Turns out convincing random people to install shit on the door was really hard. It's also expensive as a college student to buy hardware. And that took that out of the way. And Jen's asked a very important question. Am I a fan of PHP? No, I fucking hate PHP. It is a god awful language because C is beautiful.

Dex (roastmaster General) (07:44.472)
Yeah

Dex (roastmaster General) (07:54.798)
That was my first job. My first job involved a lot of translating like legacy code igniter PHP into like Python Django routes. yeah, was, it was a long time ago. That was an interesting time.

Vaibhav (08:06.287)
that's wild.

You must have felt much better getting rid of that code and putting something slightly better, though Python is kind of shit too.

Dex (roastmaster General) (08:14.218)
It was they tell you in startups don't do hero work, but there's like a kind of hero work that is also like dumb chores. But everyone's like, holy shit, you did the dishes. Amazing. Like you did the nasty thing that no one wanted to do. This is a bad example. We get what I mean. Yeah, I was also like the programming I did between my junior and senior year of high school. I did this internship at NASA where

Vaibhav (08:30.082)
Yeah, exactly. Like the migrating occurred. I think...

Dex (roastmaster General) (08:43.502)
I had to learn this thing called IDL, which is like a programming language used by astrophysicists. And it's just like, I don't know if you ever use like Wolfram or things like this. It was kind of Matlab-y, but it was also like the syntax looks like Fortran. So like I learned to program using like the worst programming paradigms that exist where like everything is passed by reference and not by value. And so like literally to return a value, you just write something into the pointer that was passed in and like to declare.

Vaibhav (08:47.661)
yeah.

Vaibhav (08:52.374)
That one. Yeah.

Vaibhav (08:58.528)
Vaibhav (09:11.554)
even for like primitive types.

Dex (roastmaster General) (09:14.508)
I mean, this was a little bit higher level and it had some OOP stuff. So like it was better than that, but like, it was, it was written by Fortran people. And so it had a lot of weird like Fortran features that was like, there was a little, yeah. Anyways, I remember I got on. Yeah.

Vaibhav (09:17.69)
I see.

Vaibhav (09:26.66)
Yeah. It's interesting how language has really shaped the way you think. I like I think because I ended up doing like, seems like that language is probably created because of like, you Fortran devs about that are like, need something slightly better than Fortran, but like not Python because like Python would be absurd to invent. If you were coming from a Fortran C world, it's just not a natural thing. And I think like, from my perspective, I spent

Dex (roastmaster General) (09:49.507)
Yeah?

Vaibhav (09:52.847)
basically my whole career writing assembly code or low level systems code and C++. And like a lot of higher level languages almost like I think for the longest time I had a version to react almost. And the reason I had like, and a version to react was because I was like,

Dex (roastmaster General) (09:57.783)
Okay.

Dex (roastmaster General) (10:10.134)
Are do you hate FP? Are you one of the anti-FP guys?

Vaibhav (10:13.844)
I do not like functional programming. think functional programming is unmaintainable code because most people in the world don't learn it. So it's not even a matter of like functional program itself. It's just that the number of people that know it is so small and it's been around for so long. I just don't see a world long-term where everyone learns it. Therefore it's unmaintainable code.

Dex (roastmaster General) (10:31.768)
So by that logic, you love TypeScript and React just for the fact that lots and lots of people know it.

Vaibhav (10:39.352)
Well, kind of, I really do like TypeScript. I really do like React actually. funny enough, I think there's the product somewhere on my GitHub. You can find something called like a secret Santa thing. And when I, I made a secret Santa thing at some point, and that was when I first did web dev after like a decade, I'm not doing it basically since the PHP days. And when I built it, I remember doing something where I was like, screw this React thing. I'm not going to learn React. So I built my own version of React with state management, page controllers and everything and routing and everything from scratch.

Dex (roastmaster General) (11:07.8)
Hahaha

Vaibhav (11:09.136)
Cause like it's just JavaScript. How hard can it be? and when I did that, I then eventually I started this company, I started doing startup stuff with Aaron and Aaron was like, I was like, we can use my thing. I have a really good library for web them. He didn't know web them either. And he was like, hell no, we're to learn react. And actually that

Dex (roastmaster General) (11:26.882)
Was this the life plus plus thing or is this way later?

Vaibhav (11:31.182)
This is way later. This is way later.

Dex (roastmaster General) (11:32.598)
Okay, I want to hear about the first startup you started. So you did, you graduated college, did a bunch of internships, and then you did, what was the first one, was it Microsoft or Google?

Vaibhav (11:43.202)
Microsoft first. So I was actually doing a startup right out of college. I was trying to do one called like a glucose meter. So I was trying to make a non-invasive glucometer so you can measure glucose levels with this. And the idea was I worked in like ads before this at eBay and a recommendation that engines and ads at eBay and met up for my internships. So I was like, there's some similar type of clustering here. I bet we can build really localized models for like demographics of people.

Dex (roastmaster General) (11:44.652)
Okay.

Dex (roastmaster General) (11:48.184)
Okay.

Vaibhav (12:08.751)
and find localized models that model people better rather than one global model that modeled everyone. And just like 2012, 2013 kind of era. And we actually got a YC interview back then for that, got rejected because they don't do biotech. I was like, why the heck did you fly us out here? If you don't do it. But it was really cool. Like as a sophomore in college, it was like a really nice, it felt really good, even though we didn't get in. I pursued that a little bit longer. And then at some point I was just like,

Dex (roastmaster General) (12:15.246)
Cool. Yeah.

Vaibhav (12:38.127)
I don't know, I think I just wasn't ready to be a startup founder back then. I had some co-founders. I don't think I felt 100 % in at that point. And then...

Dex (roastmaster General) (12:49.198)
Okay, so my story is like I waited too long to become a founder. think I mentioned that a little bit of like I was just like sitting around waiting for the right idea or the right co-founder and like waiting for it to happen to me. And then like one day I woke up and said, this is absolute bullshit. Like the number of people that get into this stuff and are able to do it and like kids who drop out of college to do it and like.

you just figure, you just go and you figure it out. So, okay, so you're the opposite thing. You were like, okay, maybe I'm not ready for this. I want to go. What did you want to learn? Like when you were looking, when you were like, okay, we're not doing the startup thing. And you're like, I want my first job. Like what, what, what pulled you in to what you ended up doing next?

Vaibhav (13:19.959)
It wasn't that, I-

Vaibhav (13:24.791)
It wasn't actually, I was actually all in on a startup all the way until like, all the way, think until like March of my senior year. I don't think I accepted my job offer until that point or whenever I was graduating that year, I don't think I accepted it. I actually let like, I got a return offer from Facebook. I just let it expire. My parents were pissed at me. They're like, how could you do that? Right? Cause I'm like, yeah, we just have a job offer. just let it expire for no reason. It's a pretty nice job offer on Facebook back at that time.

Dex (roastmaster General) (13:43.309)
Hahaha

Dex (roastmaster General) (13:54.808)
Sure. Okay, so up until March, you were in on the startup and then something changed and you were like, I'm gonna do something else. Like what happened?

Vaibhav (13:55.055)
And then I.

Vaibhav (14:01.903)
Yeah, was like, I think I got a call from someone pretty high up at Microsoft. They called me. They're like, so I interviewed for this team. The recruiter put me out on there. Um, and when I joined, when I interviewed for the team, the recruiter said, look, I put my leg out there. I let you interview him for this team. No one else in the country is interviewing for this team. You should meet these people. These people are really, really good. So I met them and the people are just amazing. Uh, they, they could even tell me what I was working on. They're like, it's super secret. You can't know what it is until it's.

until either you join or we announce it. But the people I met were just incredible. Like I think the person I ended up being my boss, Michael Gorley, he was a, he ended up building the physics engine for FIFA. Later people on that team went on to go build like self-driving Tesla and like lead self-driving Tesla and a bunch of other random things like that. And it was just phenomenal how well the team worked. I was just like, holy cow, this place is magic. And I was...

Dex (roastmaster General) (14:42.872)
Cool.

Vaibhav (14:59.203)
Somehow lucky enough to join that team. Like in college, I used to think I was pretty damn good. Like relative to lot of other students at UCL, I got the YC interview, I was doing the startup thing, I was getting internships, I was mostly getting every job offer I applied for, and that's what you relatively rank yourself as. I remember walking into work. No, I'm pretty good at certain things, but I'm also really bad at certain things. Back then, I didn't know that second part. I'm really bad at certain things. I just, yeah.

Dex (roastmaster General) (15:14.796)
Not like today where you're very humble.

Dex (roastmaster General) (15:24.654)
Yeah. You knew what things you're... Okay.

Vaibhav (15:29.101)
And then I joined there and then like, I think my first code review, I submitted a code review. I submitted like my first PR and I made like, I think like a 50 line change. got 82 fricking comments on it, 82 comments. And that was like a.

Emotion.

Dex (roastmaster General) (15:46.434)
That was the real roast of ViBov, Gupta. I was gonna make this the roast of ViBov, but that was, I don't think I'll ever compete with your first code review of Microsoft then.

Vaibhav (15:49.464)
That hurts.

Vaibhav (15:54.727)
That hurt. I don't know how else to put it. Like it made me feel something. Uh, and then I did all of that. but I think that really took the team was so supportive. And like, honestly, I just took that as a way of like, okay, do the lips are right. Better code. It's good. I'm the worst one on the team. Let's just do better. And then I just grinded for a long time. I wrote a lot of code. I learned about the system. I ended up writing some really fun algorithms there. We have some of the fastest written assembly code in the world for some computer vision algorithms from that team. Um, and.

Dex (roastmaster General) (15:59.298)
What did you learn?

Dex (roastmaster General) (16:22.542)
Sick.

Vaibhav (16:23.403)
We did that for a while. And then I remember this one line that stuck in my head from our manager at the time, Drew Seidley. And what he said was, you should never be leaving a job when you're unhappy. You should always be leaving a job when you are happy. Because what ends up happening is if you're leaving a job when you're unhappy, what ends up, you end up taking the first thing that seems slightly better when you're already happy in your current position, you only search for something truly, truly, truly better.

And then what we ended up, what I ended up doing because of that is I actually interviewed for jobs every year and most years I never left because I loved my job. And then every now and then I would. So at Microsoft, I started working and I actually quit right after that. Um, I quit after three years of doing it. I did two years of the dev got promoted each year, then became a PM for about a year. And then I said, screw it. I'm going to do a startup. So I actually quit, started a company. Uh, it was in like the coding bootcamp space.

Dex (roastmaster General) (16:54.721)
I like that.

Vaibhav (17:20.709)
I was trying to compute a lambda scope.

Dex (roastmaster General) (17:21.173)
wait, you started a coding boot camp in 2018? Dude, I started a coding boot camp in 2014.

Vaibhav (17:24.847)
2015. Oh, we did the same years then I didn't like you did 2014. did. I started 2017 or something. Anyway, I did that for about a year. I'm Michael in bootcamp taught C++ because C++ is the one true language. Um, I would never do that again. I now I trust rust.

Dex (roastmaster General) (17:28.546)
same time.

Dex (roastmaster General) (17:39.214)
So yeah, I had the every boot camp in 2014, I was like, every boot camp teaches you web dev and you learn JavaScript, which is a great thing to learn because it's very visual, right? You make the change, you see it. It's like, I was like, but I started at my first job and I spent, it took me so long to figure out really basic stuff where it's just like, if someone had just told me this, you could have saved me like two weeks. And it was basic things about like web dev and Python, like backend engineering of like the difference between JSON and Addict and how to move them back and forth and like.

Vaibhav (18:03.073)
Exactly.

Dex (roastmaster General) (18:08.12)
how to use curl to test an endpoint and just really basic stuff that I'm like, I feel like if you had a good guided curriculum on this kind of more heavyweight, like backend stuff, you could create really good engineers really quickly.

Vaibhav (18:18.656)
you'd do way better.

Yeah. So I think from there, I did a couple more things. After the coding bootcamp, I kind of moved on. I went to Google after that. was like, I just don't like, I don't think I liked idea of doing a coding bootcamp as a solo founder. I will never do a startup again as a solo founder. was fricking miserable. I made money, but it was just not happy and chasing. Yeah, exactly. Chasing money is fucking dumb.

Dex (roastmaster General) (18:40.972)
It's not fun. I think we're both the type of person that draws a lot of energy from working with someone else who's as bought in as you are.

Vaibhav (18:51.47)
Yeah. And I just want to have, I want to believe the thing I'm doing is going to be like worth it long-term and not just like a way to temporarily make money. cause that's kind of dumb. There's easier ways to make money that are way less effort than doing this company. So we did that for a while. Then I did Google, build face ID, switched to a hedge fund, worked at Disha. Went through a breakup, did a bunch of random stuff like that. And I was like, screw it. And then at some point we got to where we are here in the blog post, which is.

Dex (roastmaster General) (19:06.701)
Yeah.

Vaibhav (19:20.8)
We've now gone through five years.

Dex (roastmaster General) (19:20.91)
I want to hear one, before we get in the blog post, I want to save lots of time. save at least 20 or 30 minutes for the BAML journey. Like, what's the coolest thing you built at DE Shock? Cause like, I've heard the story of that job and why you liked it so much. And obviously there were probably downsides, like there, I know you were doing some really interesting stuff there.

Vaibhav (19:31.793)
that's pretty cool. No, there were none.

I think I built something, that was freaking cool. This I think helped us get into YC to be honest, which is, when I built a, I built the testing framework. So they had like a really, really big Python code base. Like, I don't know, like 30 years old, can imagine how many Python hacks they've done in that Python code base. They've done every possible imaginable hack, every single thing you're not supposed to do. They've done somewhere just because it's a big code base.

And there's CI CD. So take about like 30 something hours to run. So coming from Google, I was like, yeah, you can't exactly. So coming from Google, I was like, okay, well, that's absurd. That's how you do it. So as my first Instagram, let's add, let's add basil to everything. If we add basil, we have dependencies. If you have dependencies, we can run, can prune with tests. have to run change the build system for a 30 year old company is unmanageably impossible. It's just not going to happen.

Dex (roastmaster General) (20:12.792)
So you can't even run it once a day.

Dex (roastmaster General) (20:29.058)
Okay.

Vaibhav (20:36.57)
One because dazzle is impossible to use outside of Google. And two, it's such a high learning curve for all every other person in the company. That's not worth it. So that was a no go.

Dex (roastmaster General) (20:43.916)
I remember I spent about an hour trying to learn Bazel one time and like to whenever like it became there was like what's doing numbers on hacker news in the mid 2010s and I was just like, yeah, I don't think this is for me.

Vaibhav (20:47.67)
It just...

Vaibhav (20:52.022)
Yeah, exactly. Like if you start from day one and you're in the golden land, sure. But if you, if you don't and you want to use anything outside, it just doesn't work. So that didn't work. So then I said, okay, what if we built an algorithm that could predict what code had to, what tests have to run based on a get diff? and that is very hard for reasons that are not obvious in Python, but like, if you have global variables, you can change a variable from being a function name to a variable later in the code that just works.

dynamic imports can have impacts on global variables in ways that you cannot predict. You can do all sorts of lazy loading and other parameters. So it ended up being a much harder problem than I originally thought out to do, but it worked. We actually built it. We reduced the CI-CD time to under, I think, well under 10, five minutes from 33 hours, so like 90 % of commits.

Dex (roastmaster General) (21:43.352)
Okay, so you built a system that looks at a developer's incoming Git patch and then runs this algorithm that you invented, came up with, and decides here's the exact set of tests that need to run to make sure that this code is safe and guarantees that like none of the other tests are worth running.

Vaibhav (22:03.701)
Exactly. And it was like a foundational shift. It's, it goes from like not having get pre-commit hooks to having pre-commit hooks. and it was, really, really, really fun. when we did that, I think there was a couple of bugs that happened. It was very scary deployed across the whole company, getting company people to use it. I don't know if people still use ISIS. Yeah. Exactly.

Dex (roastmaster General) (22:05.518)
Okay.

Dex (roastmaster General) (22:22.668)
Right, because if you're wrong and you don't run a test that needs to run in production breaks, now that's on you. And you gotta go one, like you own the failure and the downtime and like it was a trading shop, right? Like it's like millions of dollars could be lost if someone introduced a bug somewhere.

Vaibhav (22:38.027)
Yeah, exactly. and then it was just like getting trust from that and the getting like, say, that's question. How do I, how did I get buy-in? I think it's not that different from doing a startup. You just have to have people trust you in the beginning. It's just your word. You have nothing else on that, but your word. Like most of his blog posts, if you go read this blog post talks about like how earlier customers, they didn't even like a product. They just liked us. and that was, that's all you're selling. and it was, it took a lot of effort. It's just.

You spend the man hours. I think people, like one of the things that we pride ourselves on our discord is we respond really fast. And I know sometimes we don't, but we generally try to. And that, that having that sort of responsiveness gets you a couple of things. And you do the same thing when you're working on a big feature like that, which is you just have to be responsive. When someone sends you an email, you're on it. When there's a bug, you fix it and it just out and fix right away. Like the response to a bug should be.

Cool. If you can fix it within like 15 minutes, it's out and patched. Not a, Hey, this is what's on. We also did a lot of upfront work to prove that. Yeah. Like I hate that. I hate that answer. I tell people on my team, like, Hey, if this is a thing that takes less than 10 or 15 minutes to do, do not file a ticket. I don't want to see that ticket either do it or don't do it. Make the decision right then. And like, that's my whole point about most of this stuff. And I think that's how you get the buy-in. People just trust you.

Dex (roastmaster General) (23:40.664)
We'll prioritize it for the next sprint or whatever it is.

Dex (roastmaster General) (23:52.91)
Let's go do it.

Vaibhav (24:01.025)
And then eventually you do a slow rollout with like all sorts of contingencies built in, like don't kill the old system, like leave the old system in place.

Dex (roastmaster General) (24:05.026)
That's what, that's what I love about the, the like Paul Buckeye, like Gmail story is like, it's not just about like, people will love you if you solve their problem. Like he launched Gmail to like a hundred engineers and then stayed up till 3 a.m. every night for like two or three weeks until the bugs started to slow down. He just fixed every single thing. And that's what made people keep using it. And I tell people, like, if you're in a startup and you like, you get a customer who's down to try your stuff, meet with them every single day, like solve their biggest problem.

Vaibhav (24:19.307)
Exactly.

Dex (roastmaster General) (24:34.178)
Go sit down with them tomorrow, find out what their next biggest problem is, solve that. That's how you build a product that actually rocks.

Vaibhav (24:38.743)
Well, I actually, think in theory, yes, I think it's really hard to find people that are willing to sit down with you because they're actually useful customers. They're, they're just, how'd I put it? They're busy. Like they don't like, like I.

Dex (roastmaster General) (24:53.154)
That's true. If someone's going to give up half an hour a day, they might not be doing anything interesting.

Vaibhav (24:58.655)
Exactly. Like there's no way I could convince like the most senior traders to give me half an hour a day. You know how many millions of dollars of time I'm stealing from the company to go do that? It's impossible. So it's more about building a process so that when something is broken, they know who to respond to and how to get in touch with you and they know that you're available. And it's the same thing with startup stuff as well. It's like just always be around and like what presence is super understated.

Dex (roastmaster General) (25:16.503)
OK.

Dex (roastmaster General) (25:25.378)
Yeah, build trust. Okay, cool. So let's talk about the startup. How did you meet your co-founder and like, when did you guys, what made you guys decide to do this crazy thing? Yeah, okay, cool. We got pictures.

Vaibhav (25:36.654)
This time, the time that's probably easier. Um, so I met, started after the, while I was in the D shop and I was still running the bootcamp thing online. Uh, basically, I just did that while Google and, uh, Google is going on D show is going on. But at some point, like I said, I went through like, uh, Aaron, we started working on a stupid idea I had, which was interactive Twitch ads. I'll show you guys what it looks like just so you can get an idea. this is like the one of the first ideas I had.

Dex (roastmaster General) (25:39.555)
Yeah.

Dex (roastmaster General) (25:45.658)
cool.

Vaibhav (26:04.013)
And the idea was like, we would, and I built this ad, they try and convince them YouTubers to use us. Uh, so it's like a League of Legends game and it would like pop up an ad, uh, while that's interactive and like, while the chat would interact with you, it would basically like kind of engage people for like micro events along the way. And why I thought this was a good idea. have no idea. I didn't watch Twitch. didn't do, I hated ads. That's why I work at Meadow or I, why I didn't work at eBay.

Dex (roastmaster General) (26:31.157)
haha

Vaibhav (26:32.109)
I hated ads, but like for some reason, this was a thing to go do. and, uh, yeah, exactly. For Sean's time was that, uh, I thought it'd be a good idea. And we had streamers that were kind of interested in this too. Uh, but using this, kind of was like, okay, who's the best co-founder for this? Uh, my brain immediately went to Aaron. Aaron ran a YouTube channel. He had like 14, 15 million views on his channel, uh, back in college. And then he was like, I was like, I hit him up.

He was in Paris at the time on vacation. And I remember I hadn't messaged him in like seven years or five years or something.

Dex (roastmaster General) (27:04.941)
You guys had never worked together. You just like met at a party or something, right?

Vaibhav (27:09.259)
We met at a party like seven years before this or five years before this, right? When you graduated, just for friends, we hung out really a lot for like a year. Literally that's it. That was the Aaron is the guy. And I just got him at a time when he was also down to do a startup. He had been at Amazon for like seven years. He was like, okay, I'm kind of done with this thing. He wasn't really enjoying day to day. But I think I made one really big mistake, back then, which is I believed I could do a startup while working.

Dex (roastmaster General) (27:14.806)
And you woke up one morning and you were like, Aaron is the guy?

Vaibhav (27:38.501)
as my at my job full time. I genuinely believe this. I was like, I can bootstrap this thing, let it run as a side business or do whatever I need to. And the reason was I can work like 12 hour days, no problem. I can work 16 hour days, no problem for like months on end. I did that from all my jobs. So I was like, I can do eight hours, eight hours. That's actually not sustainable. It is a totally absurd idea to go do that. and when I, when I think about

Dex (roastmaster General) (27:40.792)
Yeah, heard it.

Vaibhav (28:07.35)
doing that. I don't know what made me think I could do that. But I, one thing I've now realized is when you're working eight hours a day, it's not enough time and you're working at startup, you need your downtime. When you're just idling, you need that background process to run and think about like, what's the next thing you can be doing? The background process can't be, what am going to present on my company's stand up tomorrow? Like that is

Dex (roastmaster General) (28:27.063)
I literally woke up at three in the morning last night with an idea to solve a problem I've been thinking about for two weeks.

Vaibhav (28:31.788)
Exactly. Yeah, there's you just can't compete with someone that's full time. It's impossible. We did get a YC interview while we were part time. I think the funniest thing about this YC interview when we did this is this part. I think that YC interviews are for those of you that don't know are supposed to run 10 minutes long. This one ended in six minutes. Michael Seibel straight up was like in the interview. This was the last question he asked us, which is do you guys even watch Twitch?

It's like he, and he made Twitch. He's also the YCE, he was the YCE managing partner at that time as well. And it was just absurd what we were trying to do because we didn't watch Twitch. Well, we said, yes, we did, obviously, because like what else? We had kind of self-justified to ourselves that we're, we're the right people to build this idea, but we're absolutely not. Like we didn't actually watch Twitch. were like 30 year old dudes that just didn't watch Twitch anymore.

Dex (roastmaster General) (29:07.606)
And you said no and he was like, cool, see you later.

Vaibhav (29:25.108)
It was a wrong demographic. Another really important question that he asked us is, you know any other business that's a billion dollar business built on top of Twitch? And answer is no. It's because Twitch just doesn't want that. They don't, they don't want you to build a billion dollar business on top of them. They want to build ads. They want to build the whole platform. It's

Dex (roastmaster General) (29:40.15)
It's the same thing with LinkedIn. Every founder who tells me they want to build on LinkedIn is like, if you build a $10 million business, not even a billion, if you build a $10 million business, you really think they're going to let you keep using their API and their data to do that? No, they're just going to copy you and put it in the prop.

Vaibhav (29:49.055)
Exactly.

Vaibhav (29:52.883)
or, or they'll like, strike you down. don't want you. LinkedIn is not a platform that you build on top of that you build products on top of LinkedIn is a platform on which you build people and influencers on top of. Right. It's like same with Facebook, same with Instagram, same with Twitter, like all these social network kind of things. They don't want you to build things on top of them. and that was kind of very, very obvious, I think to Michael, because I guess he built it. He kind of made a story of the methods of Twitch, especially at Amazon.

like post startup Twitch and it's different than what Twitch was beforehand. after that we pivot around a bunch of ideas. Yeah. Then we, I think we both stayed up the whole night independently came up with a whole new idea, came up with more ideas, came up with more ideas. like, literally we get rejected. go into like pivot hell. then like sometime Aaron, Aaron quits his job at Amazon. He's like, I can't do this part-time thing. I'm done.

Dex (roastmaster General) (30:27.552)
Okay, so you get rejected by Michael.

Vaibhav (30:49.004)
I have to do this full time, no other way around this. Four months later, like I said, I just go through the first one, I'm like, screw it, I'll go full time too. It took us about four months to get there though. There's a whole section on here that talks about how we actually made it work and how we ended up both feeling good. But I think the biggest learning was just that like, this was like the thing that we were doing. We just moved the goalposts a lot. And I think a lot of founders do this. Where,

There's this very common trope that I hear between a lot of founders and now it's really easy to recognize, which is someone says, I'm going to build this thing and when this thing works, we'll get to do this thing. And this is the thing we'll actually use to make money. I think you said that to me once too. yeah.

Dex (roastmaster General) (31:28.398)
We were talking about this last week. No, you were the one who first said that to me and I was like, yeah, I mean, it's a thing that I thought about a lot, but like, yeah, the way you put it was really good, which is like, just go do the thing that you wanna do.

Vaibhav (31:34.998)
Yes.

Yeah, do the second thing. Why would you ever try to build one business and build a second business? And it's just silly to go do. And it seems obvious when you're first in hindsight, but when you're doing it, you're like, obviously these are the steps I need to do to build a giant, giant business.

Dex (roastmaster General) (31:59.906)
Well, it's like the first thing is like kind of working. You're making money, you have some customers, you don't want to let them down. Like you wrote a lot of code that is working, like you're proud of it, whatever it is. It's very hard to just be like, this isn't the billion dollar business that I want to build. There's a better thing. Like, cool, how do we get to the new thing as quickly as possible? Not like try to back into like, well, here's how we could turn the thing we have into the new thing.

Vaibhav (32:23.668)
Exactly. Exactly. And then like what we ended up doing is like we got a YC off of our next idea, which is a Slack competitor. You can go read about it, but I'll give you the TLDR, which is caring about a problem is not enough to build, enough to win. Like you can't just care about a product. Aaron and I were like, I wrote assembly. did like backend core infra. We can't build on UX. Like we're not going to win on UX no matter what. I mean, we might. It's just a bad game to play though.

You're not playing stacked odds. You're playing. Yeah, I'm, playing a losing deck and like, we're pretty good engineers, but why would I play in a losing playing field? I'm like, no matter how hard I tried, I'm not going to be like a staff level designer. I'm just not, I don't have the background. It's not, it's not who I am. And then eventually we went to pivot hell. We did a bunch of other ideas, including like AI powered drive-throughs.

Dex (roastmaster General) (32:53.974)
Yeah, you're stacking the deck against yourself.

Dex (roastmaster General) (33:18.978)
You drove to every Taco Bell Wendy's Burger King trying to convince them to use your AI drive-through. It was like voice AI to take people's orders and stuff.

Vaibhav (33:21.643)
Yeah.

Exactly. Yeah, it was the

Exactly. remember a lot of what Aaron said, which was, or not Aaron, when Greg joined us, was like, I'm so glad I didn't meet you guys during your Taco Bell drive-through days. Cause like it was a different kind of startup back then. We did a bunch of other things.

Dex (roastmaster General) (33:48.13)
And then the last pivot was one day, voice chat app with an AI personal assistant. You spent one day on that and Aaron was like, nope.

Vaibhav (33:55.53)
Yeah, because I think we were trying to go back to like a Slack competitor like thing. That's what I was trying to do. Cause I was like, I was feeling really emotionally lost. So I was like, let me go do something else. And then we tried it and just.

Dex (roastmaster General) (34:05.74)
What was the, like, lowest point during this, like, pivot hell? Like, I imagine there's a lot of moments where you're like, fuck, this isn't gonna work either. But, like, what was the deepest low point? Yeah.

Vaibhav (34:10.201)
Vaibhav (34:13.617)
You can go read this. This one wouldn't be pivoted. It's like the day of pivoting was fricking miserable. And then post-pivoting was...

Dex (roastmaster General) (34:21.122)
when you decided to throw out the Slack competitor.

Vaibhav (34:24.147)
Yeah, it was miserable. then we got making MRR. We started making MRR on the next idea, which was a custom embeddings. And then I don't know if you can tell. I clearly was not having conviction at some point. So the

Dex (roastmaster General) (34:35.778)
This is it. You can tell when you're losing conviction. You know how I know? It's because if I'm excited and I'm on an airplane, I'm coding. And the minute I'm sitting on a plane and I'm like, I don't wanna work, I'm gonna watch a movie, that's how I know something's not working.

Vaibhav (34:39.556)
Hahaha!

Vaibhav (34:44.617)
I'm co- exactly.

Vaibhav (34:52.203)
Exactly. So like the batch ended in like February and like March. I had a little bit of conviction April and I was like, I just lost it. I like we're, making revenue. Numbers are going up. I was like, this is so dumb. Well, we can't build a thing on custom embeddings. So let me pivot it away. And then we started looking at like LMSCKs. And some of you might've seen this, which was like lane chain with the big thing at that time. And I was just looking at this. was like, holy fricking shit. This can't be the future. There's just no fricking way. This is the future that I want to live in.

It's like, why are we importing abstractions of the sake of abstraction? We're writing system message and human message. Like, what is this nonsense? And I, yeah, but like it's abstraction for the sake of abstraction is the way I'd put it. And at some point, I think we're just starting, we're just like really sad one night and like, we're just like the things that we built are also just as nasty. We didn't even like it.

Dex (roastmaster General) (35:28.929)
It's a string.

Dex (roastmaster General) (35:45.902)
You built a library for, is this the library for embeddings or was this another library you were hacking on?

Vaibhav (35:50.184)
It was like on top of embeddings, so like custom classification and all this other stuff. Nothing felt good. It felt like abstraction for the sake of abstraction. So we tried YAML files. We tried Python SDKs, we JavaScript SDKs. Everything was ugly. And we're just not proud of the work that we built. Like Aaron and I are like, we like code. Code is art and it should be represented as such. So like when we were shipping this code, even though people were wanting to use us and pay us, it felt like crap. Cause I felt like I was selling them something that I knew I wouldn't want to use.

So then literally one night I was just like, we're just hanging out like late night and I was like, let's build a programming language. And then that was it.

Dex (roastmaster General) (36:27.032)
And then what happened? You walked to the whiteboard and started sketching it out? Or like you just started thinking about it? Or like did you fall in love with the problem or what?

Vaibhav (36:31.163)
Literally, literally what happened. We literally did this. We sketched out the hypothetical syntax as a pure joke. And then we had a compiler ready by like that Sunday. I went home, wrote it, and then turns out getting users for programming language is really, really, really hard. Somehow some of them used us. And all this started working. But then we realized how hard this actually is. If know what someone thought about it, it's just, there's a lot like

I think there's like how, um, there's this essence of how tall does a startup have to be in order for it to sell something. Most startups you can sell before you build something like how much they have to have get done before you can sell something. Some startups you can sell before you build it. Some startups you have to build a prototype. Then you can sell it. Some startups you got to build the whole thing and no one will buy it until it's done. Like there's no pre-order. has to be fully done.

Dex (roastmaster General) (37:08.888)
What do you mean by tall?

Dex (roastmaster General) (37:23.95)
Hmm.

Vaibhav (37:26.219)
programming language, turns out at least in 2023, 2024, 2025 are way on the right hand side. And so where you just have to build a lot, like would you use our first users used BAML or at that point as well, without a syntax highlighter. Imagine just writing code in white files, like pure white, like no syntax highlighting. We didn't have an LSP. Everything did exactly.

Dex (roastmaster General) (37:45.192)
terrible. hate you didn't have an LSP. You had a language that everything worked, but no LSP. It's like, forget about it.

Vaibhav (37:53.949)
we had our compiler, you said seg faults cause there's written C plus plus and a bunch of random stuff like that. Josh. asked the question, how do we get our first customers? What's the best way of getting new customers now? the way we got our first, customers, we actually think, where is this? There's a sentence in here. I think there's someone in here. it probably is other way better, which is, this sentence.

which is like, uh, they are used to the row actually like, can we just use Python? And they actually are fighting us against using the thing because like, it's a fricking slog. Let's be real here. Uh, we argued about it for a while. Uh, but honestly, like they liked us. So they were down to trust us regardless. Cause the results that we got through our language were just better than whatever they had. Uh, and that's just partly because we probably just understood LLM slightly better than they did. So we could get a way slightly better output than they could even with a shitty language.

Dex (roastmaster General) (38:26.35)
Yeah, we just stick to Python.

Vaibhav (38:54.73)
But the, I think the big shift here was really what we had this mentality of like, I think we use this bet. We use this a lot now in the company, which is like a time bounded bet. So in this sense of like where we're feeling like shit and our customers were not wanting to use us, we basically just said, let's give ourselves to the end of the year. That's it. We just give ourselves until the end of the year. If we didn't get anything until the end of the year, then we'll, we'll pivot, screw it. We'll be out.

Dex (roastmaster General) (39:19.918)
How many months in like what month was this how many months did that give you?

Vaibhav (39:24.97)
They gave us, I think, what month was this? I have no idea. I have to go check the image. This was like right around here. So it gave us like two months or two or three months. Yeah. It was, it was like, uh, and I think it was really just semantically end of the year felt nice semantically. That's why we did that. And then we actually went back and Aaron also wasn't super happy with the syntax. He was like, it just looks like shit. And the first version of BAML was shit. I want to be very clear on that. It's cause I designed the syntax. I'm a horrible syntax.

Dex (roastmaster General) (39:28.93)
like summer-ish.

Dex (roastmaster General) (39:33.354)
Okay, you had four or five months two two more months, okay

Dex (roastmaster General) (39:53.23)
Can we see it? You should do a post of like, BAML through the ages and just like a snippet of BAML every month for the last like three years. That would be awesome.

Vaibhav (39:55.549)
I don't know if I have a lake.

I should.

Vaibhav (40:04.134)
Exactly. So I actually, should, we've shown the internal team this and just so they get an idea. And then we tried to talk about this and try and look at this. then like, eventually we just found a better syntax. We basically redesigned the syntax from scratch. We migrated every single customer. No one pivoted, which is really nice. We finally had a hundred stars. Like it's absurd. took us seven months to hit a hundred stars. And then we finally, finally, finally decided to.

Dex (roastmaster General) (40:07.394)
I bet Claude could do that if you pointed at your repo.

Vaibhav (40:31.05)
keep going. We built like the playground. We started getting feedback that was like this from engineers that we respected, which was just code is just clean. He like, think usually like 3000 plus lines of code when they migrated to BAML pretty consistently at that point. And these were companies that are starting to do some real revenue numbers now too, that were starting to migrate over.

Dex (roastmaster General) (40:53.996)
That was the thing. I mean, that was my journey, too, is like working with you and like talking to some of your customers about what they were doing with AI. was like the first time I was like, people who build and are actually doing real like shipping reliable AI, like good enough to sell to the enterprise for six figure ish contracts and people who are making a couple million in revenue. Like they have very different needs than what most of the like common tools cater to.

Vaibhav (41:16.136)
Yeah. Exactly. And it's a different business. cause like what they're thinking about is like the director of engineering or the VP of engineering is often thinking about like, they don't want a person to be a bottleneck. They want a system that is going to sustain itself and be maintainable for any engineer that comes in. So they don't make mistakes. Exactly.

Dex (roastmaster General) (41:34.242)
Yeah, they want to be able to hire, they want it to be as easy as possible to find people who know the thing and are comfortable with the code base and all of that.

Vaibhav (41:41.309)
Exactly. And that's what you care about way more than like how easy it is to get started. And the problem is almost every framework that I have seen, like everyone else was like, I'm going to pivot out. And then we did, I think that was the nice thing about Bamel. We saw that people weren't really pivoting out. actually just asked Bamel to do more and more and more. This was around the time when our JSON parsers started getting really, really good. Big, big shout out to Gabe. Gabe had this absurd use case where he was trying to get an LLMs to generate every single form of weird things possible.

So I'll show you guys some like sort of test cases I think we have in our repo just to show you guys how bad this is.

Dex (roastmaster General) (42:17.378)
Yeah, show us the Gabe Suite.

Vaibhav (42:21.103)
I think I have a bunch of tests here.

Dex (roastmaster General) (42:24.952)
You're only sharing your browser, by the way. Okay, cool.

Vaibhav (42:26.862)
I'm pulling it up really fast.

the test.

And then test classes, I think.

Vaibhav (42:40.2)
Okay, let me share my tab, because I'll show you how complicated the tests started getting at this point. Share screen.

Vaibhav (42:54.206)
So this is where we started discovering like, LM started doing like JSON problems like this. There's.

where is this? There's like markdown somewhere.

Vaibhav (43:09.354)
if I have it somewhere, this is where we discovered recursive types because structured outputs still doesn't support risk recursive types in a really good way. But there's some tests in here that I'll show this one. We discovered like internationalization, like with random tokens, like LLM don't perform super well on these always. And how do you make test cases really good for this kind of tokens? Emojis started coming up. When classes too might have some of it. There's some markdown files in here where like LLM, when you generate like super long,

Dex (roastmaster General) (43:17.165)
Mmm.

Vaibhav (43:38.91)
things like this, this doesn't always parse correctly. Cause like what happens in this scenario, we're actually generating code as a function signature and the LLM forgets quotation marks or anything like that. This is a really hard thing to parse. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.

Dex (roastmaster General) (43:49.698)
You have colons which are part of the JSON syntax. Like they're special tokens, but the LM is not escaping them or anything.

Vaibhav (43:57.744)
Exactly. Right. So you can see how like these edge cases just get bigger and bigger and bigger. It just gets worse and worse and worse. and we just hash the algorithms one by one. have tons of people just reporting all sorts of things that they're like, Hey, I see an LL I'm behaving in this way. I see an LL behaving this way. And the reason the parser is really good is not because like we've encountered every scenario ourselves. It's just because every single person at this point has really contributed to us being able to see.

so many real life scenarios that have actually happened. And then we just kept on doing that. This is how we added TypeScript support. Our users were like, Hey, can I do this in TypeScript instead of Python? And then we were like, yeah, let's make, let's give you native TypeScript support. So we started adding more languages. People are like, can I do more stuff? And the question eventually became like, and so like, can BAML do this? It just started shifting. Like if BAML can do this, it was like, Hey, can you just, instead of me writing my code to go do this, can you go add?

Can you just add this feature to BAML? It's easier for us to do it than them to do it. This is how we did streaming and all the other semantics that we kind of came up with along the way. think at some point we started feeling a little bit better in our user growth. And like, this was one of my favorite quotes from a user. like, again, some of these companies are doing quite well now and they're just like, they don't have to make, they get off the fork and maintain BAML. This is how hard committed they were into BAML. Cause they're doing, I can't say their revenue numbers, but these companies are starting.

Dex (roastmaster General) (45:23.416)
They were like, if BAML goes out of business, we will have to fork it. That's how all in we are on this system.

Vaibhav (45:28.905)
And that's how critical like they don't have a choice. Um, and it started feeling really good. Sometimes around the end of 2024, um, I started going to like YC reunions and like, remember like, this was one of my, this was the first time this ever happened to me. Uh, Andrew was an awesome person and he was like, are you the Bama guy? was writing some Bama on my flight last time that as a founder, can't even like fath, I can't even share and express how that feels as like someone that has never noticed me had never seen me. It was just like, Hey,

I was using your thing on a flight in a totally random way that last night. just, yeah, it was one of happiest days up until that point leading up into it. And then we just did this stuff for a while.

Dex (roastmaster General) (46:08.908)
That's sick. Amazing. Cool. Yeah, keep going. I do have some hard questions. I'm fine to go over and run this long, but I just, I'm.

Vaibhav (46:19.527)
I'll run this quick. I'll give you like four minutes.

Dex (roastmaster General) (46:24.078)
That's sick. Yeah. What else is worth sharing? I love this story so far. Like what were the...

Vaibhav (46:28.667)
You're probably like the building the team side. So at some point we were like, okay, well, this is not a 2 % job. so we started looking into this, which was, we started trying to hire someone. So I was like, I know Sam, I've known Sam for like five plus years. So I actually helped him interview at open AI. And I remember this text we got from Sam, after, after this, we gave him a job offer, but he, also told him, that, Hey, like congrats you. I, we want to be happy. We want you to be happy. So he ended up taking open AI.

JK, he actually joined us right afterwards. no, he just self-pivoted like after he decided opening it. He was like, no, he wanted to go do it. You can read his blog posts about what changes his mind. I don't want to speak on his behalf, but we went through there. We hired our own intern. here's why we hired our intern. Talks about it. Then we hired Greg and Antonio later that year as well. And it was just really, really fun. Like 2024, think was like the year where it stopped being from like a.

Dex (roastmaster General) (47:03.394)
Did he start at OpenAI or he like self-pivoted?

Dex (roastmaster General) (47:11.842)
Heck yeah, dude.

Vaibhav (47:29.097)
Like maybe I would might do it, maybe it won't, but eventually became a thing of like, think we're going to try this out. I think 2025 was the year of like, Oh, it doesn't show you this 2025 was like the year. Um, that was really, really nice. We had a lot of fun stuff happen. I don't think I fully reflected on all of 2025 yet.

Dex (roastmaster General) (47:44.302)
Everybody who went to day to day Texas is like that guy Vybov, where did he come from? That was the best talk I've ever seen.

Vaibhav (47:53.894)
Yeah, that was actually the first time we gave a talk publicly. I've never given one before that really about BAML and it was quite fun. It gave a lot of momentum going into the year. We gave a talk at some YC conferences. we met, started seeing comments about like on Reddit and hacker news about BAML this year. We started like BAML is number one now. We beat Bank of America, Merrill Lynch on Google, which is insane to think about.

Dex (roastmaster General) (48:18.338)
Finally.

Vaibhav (48:20.937)
we got the like seven case stars. got the gross fricking haircut. we've, we run workshops, many, many times together. Me and you Dexter, we started this. Yeah. We started the podcast together, which is fun. We've got over a hundred thousand views on the YouTube channel now for like one hour long episodes. We have like multiple fortune 500 using us to government agency startups. see like random cold out bounds from job posts from recruiters, which has been saying about BAML now. Like in general, I think it's just.

Dex (roastmaster General) (48:25.621)
You

Dex (roastmaster General) (48:29.422)
This is the New York thing.

Vaibhav (48:50.601)
It's been a really fun year. I haven't yet had the full time to reflect yet on all of 2024. We still have two days left. Anything can happen. So I'm not going to make any comments on it, but like, it's, it's really interesting. I think we've talked a lot about like what might be coming next. It's like, I think I remember looking at this part of the graph and at every single time when you zoom in, like you guys are probably looking at this and being like, Oh, this part is kind of flat. When you look at this earlier part.

I can't express how happy I was when this started happening. Like this slope felt awesome. It felt really, really, really, really good to have that happen. And I remember like we went through a slump here and then this slope felt awesome. And then this felt awesome. And then at some point I forgot to pay for post-hoc. So I should pay for post-hoc again. But I just forgot to pay the bill. So I need to go turn that off. yeah, I think it's just really,

Dex (roastmaster General) (49:24.237)
Yup.

Dex (roastmaster General) (49:38.296)
They stopped tracking your events. Yeah.

Vaibhav (49:51.289)
It's not an easy thing that we're trying to do. it, think obviously a programming language is probably one the most absurd startup ideas in the world, but I think that's what gives most of us on the team conviction that it might actually work because of that reason. There's not a lot of scenarios in which it happened. Well, like I said, I would say it's not not working. That's what I would say about them. I wouldn't say it's working, but I would say it's not not working. And

Dex (roastmaster General) (50:05.998)
because it's working.

Dex (roastmaster General) (50:16.878)
By the way, the Y-axis on this chart, this is weekly active users. Cool.

Vaibhav (50:21.468)
Yeah. So people actively writing BAML code in the world, at that time. So we're also not tracking, someone asked what happened in October, I forgot to pay postdoc for metrics. it's very hard to pay for metrics cause I forgot. think we spammed, so that was it. yeah, we're just writing a lot of And then I think at some point, like we just, we have some amount of conviction. think our next goal is like.

Dex (roastmaster General) (50:24.76)
That's sick.

Dex (roastmaster General) (50:41.614)
too busy hacking.

Vaibhav (50:50.6)
10,000 weekly active panel deaths. That's going to be the next big thing. There's some spoilers here if you want to go see them. And there's a fun little talk that's a much more polished version of my initial talk that I gave a day to day Texas later in the year. That's actually fun to watch. Yeah, it just talks about in a lot more detail. I think this talk has actually gotten surprisingly like a couple, five figures of views, which is kind of cool that people actually watch it. The comments on the YouTube are phenomenally fun to go read.

Dex (roastmaster General) (51:03.33)
just like why we need a new programming language.

Vaibhav (51:19.762)
Thanks to all of you that are watching this. I remember when I started doing this, someone was like, hey, can you please let us pay for the channel because we like the content so much? And this wouldn't have happened if I hadn't met Dex. And if we hadn't started doing this together. And I was like, I don't know what I want to do with this dollar. I don't know how to extract it out, but it's really freaking cool. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. And then obviously like.

Dex (roastmaster General) (51:37.902)
The people just want to toss us a tip for making content. It's fun. You got to start spelling my name right.

Vaibhav (51:48.632)
my god. Dude, I don't know your last name. I'm sorry. You need to change to Twitter. Same thing to what I did, which is easier to spell.

Dex (roastmaster General) (51:55.938)
Dex code.

Vaibhav (51:57.572)
Yeah, Dexco, there you go.

Dex (roastmaster General) (52:01.166)
What's I have some random questions. This is awesome. This is exciting. I I feel like I need to do a part two where I talk through kind of like the I need to write this down and like the visual aid is nice because like there's this like arc of like 12 factor agents on hacker news and then the conference talk and then the coding agent stuff that like I think probably could be visual on that note. One thing I wrote down is like you're really good writer and speaker and I'm curious like to what

Vaibhav (52:03.014)
But that's kind of the journey so far. Yeah.

Dex (roastmaster General) (52:31.102)
I think it's super, super important. was actually talking to my co-founder about this last week and I'm just like, Kyle, you're a really good writer. He's like, yeah, I took like a technical like writing and communications class and I'm curious, like, have you always been a good writer? Is it something you learned? Like, how can people...

Vaibhav (52:44.296)
actually a bad writer. If you read my writing, it's trash. Most of the writing that is good is because I've run it through so many other people. I've run it through Sam on our team. I've run it through Greg. I've run it through Erin. I've run it through my girlfriend. And I run it through people to make sure it's actually like tangible and make sense. Speaking, think I'm much more better at than writing. But I think most of the speaking just comes from like having energy. Like when I go on stage, I smile.

Dex (roastmaster General) (53:01.208)
Good answer.

Vaibhav (53:10.894)
And it turns out, think that's, that's like 80 % of it is like, Be happy and talk about something you're excited about. I can't, like, I'm super proud of the work we've done at Boundary. Like when we build demo, when we build all this stuff, I am so fucking proud of it. I'm so proud of every single person on the team. I'm so proud of like everyone that like, there was like a bug like two days ago, like, and I remember like someone commented on, on like a Slack thing and responded, ship to fix within a day.

It's the same with like Greg, like we had a bug like a little bit ago when we first released timeouts, it was like patched within like less than a day. And it's just not, it's cool that we don't have to ask people to do this. People are excited to do this kind of work. They naturally do it. It's like the natural team culture around and community is super helpful too. Like I haven't seen an issue, uh, that has been involved where people aren't actually like, here's my bug. Here's the problem. Here's how I encountered. actually do a good job of helping us out. And I.

Dex (roastmaster General) (54:07.468)
Yeah, you've done a good job of like attracting really high quality people into the community as well.

Vaibhav (54:13.455)
Yeah, so like when I talk about it, I'm just speaking with pride. So it's easy for me to be excited and talk about it because I'm not really faking it. It's truly how I feel about it. And the day I'm annoyed by it, you will hear it. And I will express that annoyance and you will feel it very directly. And we will make it better to not make it so that's the case.

Dex (roastmaster General) (54:26.097)
Hahaha

Dex (roastmaster General) (54:30.306)
Yeah.

Dex (roastmaster General) (54:34.198)
Alright, which hard question do you want, number one or number two?

Vaibhav (54:38.855)
Give it to me both.

Dex (roastmaster General) (54:40.814)
All right, number one, I love BAML, I use BAML every time I'm doing AI scripts. I have talked to some smart people who spend a lot, a lot, a lot of time with LLMs. And the thing they tell me and the thing I hear and is like a reasonable thing to say is like the labs are constantly improving their tool calling and their parsing and like under the hood it's even XML, it's not even JSON anymore.

It seems in a little bit of a way that like the part of BAML that is calling LLMs and doing the parsing and leaning into the like JSON-ish or scheme-aloud parser stuff is sort of a bet against the labs continuing to get much, much better at tool calling. Like how do you fit that into your worldview and strategy? Like, do you agree with that perspective and like, how are you thinking about that?

Vaibhav (55:24.86)
Yeah.

Vaibhav (55:30.051)
That's a really, really good question. I've been asked that a few times, often by many like yourselves, many, many good engineers. It's probably the first question people ask is like, is BAML by Jason Parsing? It's actually not at all about that. I think it started off that way because that was the biggest problem people had back in the early day. But I think the way that I have seen it and like, I know a lot of people are saying like, like maybe like two or three years will definitely have really good structured outputs.

But firstly, that's not the code base we live in today. So you got to write code for today. And that's something that bamboo does really, really well. And then there's another part of it. That's just like, how are you going to actually like streaming streaming semantics? You can't possibly do streaming semantics in the lab side. It's an application level construct. There's nothing that the labs can. Yeah, it has nothing to do with that. And I'll show you like a, well, like here, let me screen share my screen. I'll just screen share my whole screen.

Dex (roastmaster General) (56:16.226)
Right, it's about parsing and processing data.

Vaibhav (56:28.591)
And then we'll see stuff cursor file in the window. Now let's give a really, really quick example to show what I mean.

Dex (roastmaster General) (56:38.222)
You're gonna need to zoom this in by the way.

Vaibhav (56:40.655)
I will, I know. I worked on very, very tiny fonts.

Dex (roastmaster General) (56:45.208)
We only gotta like just inject as much code into the brain stem as possible,

Vaibhav (56:49.635)
Exactly. It's just context windows. So like, for example, when I do streaming, when I'm, when I'm parsing like this experience array, whether I want like the whole thing to arbitrarily stream or whether I want the experience to stream or whether I want, whether I want the list to stream, whether I want the object to stream or whether I want every single character to stream is a choice. And how do you express that choice in a sensible way? That's really hard. That's not a lab construct because the LLM is still going to do the same thing, regardless of the behavior.

And some people might s- Go ahead.

Dex (roastmaster General) (57:18.542)
And I can imagine what a SDK that was like TypeScript native to build this kind of logic would look like. it basically becomes a really ugly DSL.

Vaibhav (57:27.259)
You can't do it in TypeScript. Yeah. Exactly. You can't do it in TypeScript. And the reason you can't do it in TypeScript is because fundamentally what you have here is when you have a dual type system, you have a type where during streaming you have one type. And then during, during non-streaming, have a totally different type. And how you can't, most languages don't have a way to represent two type systems at the same time. So even if you wanted to, you can't do this.

Dex (roastmaster General) (57:50.476)
Yeah. It's sort of the... You have Zod for your schemas and then you have runtime types as well, but it's like that problem multiplied out by like two additional dimensions basically.

Vaibhav (58:01.315)
Exactly. And Perry brought up a good point. Like, why can't you optionalize everything? Well, you can optionalize everything, but then the problem is like, now when I do this, I'll show what I mean.

Dex (roastmaster General) (58:10.444)
Now your code is ugly. You gotta check everything.

Vaibhav (58:13.227)
Well, I'm yeah, exactly. Now everything becomes like a checked experience along the way where everything in here is now like an experience. I didn't update the type. There we go. Now everything becomes like an optional type in my stream. So now everything is optional. But what if I don't want the actual experience object to be optional? I want this thing to happen only when it's actually done. Well, now I'm actually getting that in a, in a more type safe way.

And that's just like a hard construct to represent because it's very situation dependent. and it, yeah.

Dex (roastmaster General) (58:47.212)
Yeah. Anyways, we're talking more about streaming next week. That makes a ton of sense. Yeah, the typing and stream processing, and then I know you've demoed a couple times the like, BAML is gonna be a full-on Turing complete programming language kind of experiments that y'all are working on that I'm very excited to play with. All right.

Vaibhav (59:03.815)
I'll show you.

I think I have a video. I'll show the real version too. Like this video probably does it over here. Where it's like, as I'm running this, uh, it's just like tooling. What tooling do you want to run your code? Now that like, you're going to buy better. Everything. Like do you want diagrams that just show your code? Oh, yes, that is probably true.

Dex (roastmaster General) (59:18.936)
This is really hard to see, by the way.

Vaibhav (59:25.627)
Like, do you want diagrams that like show your code as you, as you execute them? like when you go execute, you can just like see what your code is visually represented as really quickly. Do you want to be able to like run your code and see exactly what sections are running really quickly without having to actually write code in a graph where you're just being able to write like if statements for loops, et cetera. And I know this super low res, they'll get updated in a bit. YouTube is still processing the video. And I think that's kind of like the premise here is like, how do you, how do you build software in a world where everything is vibe coded?

Dex (roastmaster General) (59:55.946)
And everything is non-deterministic, right? And everything is asynchronous. Like API calls were just like send it off and wait for the response and go. It's like now it's like, well, the stuff streams back and sometimes it takes a long time. And sometimes like there's a long time to first token also. Like what are the software primitives we need? Okay. Second hard question. Not really that hard. This is an easier one, but like, what is your, I mean, a thing that I get as advice from a lot of good founders and investors is like,

Vaibhav (59:57.871)
Exactly.

Vaibhav (01:00:12.324)
Exactly.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:00:23.018)
You need to be able to build without external validation because that shit comes and goes and like people will love you and then people will hate you. So like, what is the deep burning thing that you wake up with every day that like motivates you to keep building even in the hardest of times?

Vaibhav (01:00:41.574)
I really, really, really liked Beautiful Code. That's it. Like I, I love code. There's no other thing around it. And like, think every single software paradigm that has come to date has brought with it a new way to express those ideas, whether through a framework or through a language, it doesn't really matter, but through some foundational unique way. SQL was a really good way to think about data and like how you're storing data over time and accessing data.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:01:08.95)
Yeah!

Vaibhav (01:01:09.35)
As good and bad as it is, it's really nice, in my opinion. Document stores were a new way to think about a new type of data interaction. Operating systems came along and we'd the Java. And I think these abstractions, like Linux, a beautiful abstraction over hardware. There's so much, like the pipe system, and the Unix pipe is such a cool thing where you can just run one program, send the data immediately to another one. These abstractions are so beautifully done.

kind of gets me really excited around them. It's like, how do you compose things in a nice way? And when I think about LLMs, I think there's two different ways to think about LLMs. One is LLMs are just a high level construct or a different way to think about them is models are primitive that are similar to like an operator, like plus or minus. We don't really think about how plus or minus works. We just have some expectations around when you do A plus B, C happens. That's kind of how I think about LLMs.

LLMs are like, when you take an LLM, apply a prompt into it. Something should happen and you can build an expectation around that using a type system. And then what is all the tooling you need around that to make that really, really, really beautiful and fun to use. And that's, that's what motivates us is like make that tooling beautiful. And then really just the data they grind people don't talk about, which is like. Hear complaints from users on discord and go build it. Having a really wild idea, like instead of like talking about it, just go do it.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:02:30.403)
Yeah.

Vaibhav (01:02:34.394)
Like, there's so many times when I see people talking about stupid ideas and like, don't do them. And who knows that stupid idea would have worked or not worked. But if you don't, if building something is, takes you way longer than you think it does, then like, perhaps talking about it will take even longer. Let's go, let's go build the thing and just go see people love it. And if you have Amazon has this really good leadership principle, which is like great leader, right a lot.

And I think not enough startup founders talk about this, but honestly, this building a startup is about making the right bets. And like, if you make the right bets, you will win. And if you don't, you will lose. So you might as well make the best and just see what burns out faster, like your ideas or like the fuel that you have inside of you and the motivation.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:03:19.532)
I like it. That's great. Yeah. So company, I mean, company dies. Neither of you make any money. You will be like, we made something beautiful that thousands and thousands of maybe millions of people love.

Vaibhav (01:03:31.718)
I think probably someone will acqui hire a team of like really, really good engineers that can solve really hard problems in the AI space at some point, if we really need to. So I'm not too worried about that downside risk. Yeah, but I'm talking about like downside risk from an employee standpoint. Like that's like the worst downside risk. It's not really like we'll be out of jobs. Aaron and I will do our best to make sure everyone does okay. But the...

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:03:41.73)
No, no. Billion dollar company.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:03:54.434)
Yeah, Ben Stansel had this blog post on like the downsides of taking venture capital money and being a founder and like, there's not really any. It's like, well, okay. So if you, if you, if you start a startup and you fail. What?

Vaibhav (01:04:03.492)
No, there are overvaluations. Overvaluations will screw you if you think that you see money.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:04:09.548)
Sure. No, the point I'm making, like one of the points he makes is like, yeah, so if I take money from VCs and then I don't do a good job, then they're not gonna give me money again, right? It's like, no, they love second time founders. It's like, there's like all this upside and like the worst case scenario is you get acquihired or you run out of money and go get a regular job and like you can still do it again and again and again. It's like, do the thing that you love and follow that intrinsic motivation to whatever.

Vaibhav (01:04:19.686)
Yeah, exactly.

Vaibhav (01:04:33.114)
Yeah. Well.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:04:38.764)
I don't know, what do you think?

Vaibhav (01:04:41.05)
I think the worst case scenario is actually lost opportunity time. Like when you're doing the startup, you're giving up a lot of time. You're giving away time with family, friends, partners, like all these other things that pattern in life and all that, like, like where does the response in the sun, the boundary discord come from? It comes from like in the beginning, me and Aaron literally giving up all that time. All right. even now we don't want the team to do most of it because like, don't, I don't think the team should take the same level of,

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:04:45.25)
That's true. It's your time is the big cost.

Vaibhav (01:05:09.254)
like 24 seven ish yet on that as we do, but they help out a lot on the weekends and Fridays and all this other stuff. Uh, and they help out in the week during the weekdays too, but like all that time comes from the team too, from their parents, from their like families, partners. Yeah. And like sacrifice there is just, that's the real sacrifice of doing a startup is you are going to not have friends that you used to have. You are like, you will make new friends that you would, that you would not have had otherwise either.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:05:19.436)
Yeah. The point is, yeah, everybody's going a little above and beyond.

Vaibhav (01:05:38.672)
But like the downside is just like, I asked Sam, like, for example, I asked Sam, like, why doesn't he want to be a founder? And I remember Sam said something really good, which was he's like, I just don't want to make that time commitment yet. Cause he saw what me and earned worked like, and like, that was valid. Like he's like, it's not that he couldn't be one. just a different level of all in that you have to be. So that's, that would be my one thing. Like if you don't want to give him that time, don't be a founder.

It's not fun. But if you give up that time and you enjoy it, it is so freaking fun. I have met people that I would have never met otherwise in life. And it is, I can't express the joy. Like when I showed that image of like someone ran up and said, hey, I'm using Bamal, I use Bamal. It's I can't express the happiness that that brings. It's unfathomable amounts of joy.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:06:22.574)
Aww.

Vaibhav (01:06:33.893)
uh right now like maybe if I have kids I'll feel differently about a new level of unfathomable but like it's it's some of the happiest moments and the saddest moments have come from the startup journey

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:06:45.218)
Yeah. Of like, Hey, we made a thing and somebody loves it. like, touched a, like, you can touch and change people's lives. I mean, I don't like the whole like, we're changing the world thing, but like, you can, you can change the way people see the world and you can change the way people go through life and solve their problems. Then that's really rewarding.

Vaibhav (01:07:00.773)
Yeah, I think you can change the way people. Yeah, I think for me, software, like I said, it's something I love. like changing the way that people perceive software. That's fucking magic. It feels so good to be like, hey, people agree with this. It's like when I did the testing thing at D shop, people are like, at first they were scared. And then when they use it, they're like, it's really nice. And they believed in it. It changed the way they thought about shipping code. I think that just is fun for me. Like taking on taking a lopsided bet.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:07:19.203)
Yeah.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:07:25.379)
Yeah.

Vaibhav (01:07:29.783)
and then winning on that bet and then doing a good job at it that makes people excited to use the thing. That's happiness.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:07:36.418)
That's sick. I think that's a great one to go out on. Thank you all for coming. Any last words that you want to leave the audience with as we close out 2025?

Vaibhav (01:07:45.278)
thank you to every single one of you that has been watching this series that Dexter and I've now done for 39 episodes. It has been wild. I think Dexter, when I started this, I remember the thing I asked Dexter when we did like the first four episodes. Dexter, I was like, you want to try this out? And we're like, let's do it. we did it for four episodes. We took a break for two weeks and Dexter was like, all right, I'm in for the next, for the end of the year. We'll try this out. We'll come in it till the end of the year. And we did that. I like.

super props to Dextre for really making this as good as it is.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:08:18.7)
No, no, no, no. This is the most 50-50 thing out there, with the exception that you came to San Francisco and you came into my office on a Saturday. was working on something. We you're going to figure this out. And we sat down and made the Figma graphics and wrote the first three topics on a whiteboard. And we were like, OK, this is actually real. We can do this. This will be fun. And I don't know. I love a good YAP. So this has been incredible.

Vaibhav (01:08:25.794)
Yeah, but-

Vaibhav (01:08:36.828)
yeah.

Vaibhav (01:08:46.797)
It was really fun. So I'm really looking forward to hopefully continuing this in next year as well. And hopefully we'll see if we can do another year and make another year of good content. If you guys have suggestions for content along the way, shoot them our way, shoot them in either of our discords, send topic suggestions and we'll we'll add them to the queue. We're adding a little bit more process on there. So that means that hopefully we'll get better planning, better episodes coming out with more content.

but we are super excited to keep doing this. This is like some of my favorite moments of the week, every Tuesday. Just hop on here, yap a Dexter for like a day or like an hour, whatever it is.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:09:21.208)
It's been great, Yeah, like they said, as being a founder, might not have some of the friends you would have had otherwise, but you will meet other friends and you will meet some pretty incredible people. And I'm super grateful that we ran into each other at an AI Tinkerers in Seattle 18 months ago or whatever. And I'm super stoked for next year.

Vaibhav (01:09:31.17)
Exactly.

Vaibhav (01:09:40.001)
I know I can't even believe it's only been 18 months, which is insane to think about. but that's really fun. Thank you everyone. See you guys next year.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:09:43.916)
Yep. Yep.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:09:48.408)
Thanks everybody, get you later.

Vaibhav (01:09:54.725)
I can't stop the feed. I don't know how to stop it.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:09:56.814)
Stop the, yo stop the feed.

Vaibhav (01:09:59.653)
I literally cannot stop it. Give me one second.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:10:03.852)
Alright, next year we're gonna do streaming platforms that works, and we're gonna find one.

Vaibhav (01:10:09.125)
Did my mouse die? What happened? Okay, well, if you guys are still on, if you guys have questions, I guess you can post them. cause I can't quit.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:10:16.686)
Well, ViBop tries to quit them. Streamer edition.

Vaibhav (01:10:22.662)
This is so funny. I literally cannot quit. I'm trying to refresh the page. Refreshing won't work. I've tried everything. Maybe if I... Oh yeah, nope. That'll quit everything. I don't want to do

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:10:39.136)
Alright, he's gone. I also, I'm not a host so I can't actually use the stream controls. But let me see if he's coming back.

Dex (roastmaster General) (01:10:53.71)
All right, we're see what happens when we both leave. Everybody have a wonderful 2026 and can't wait to hack on some new AI stuff with all of you. Cheers, y'all.
