title: "Building a Prompt Optimizer"
description: |
  What happens when models can write really good prompts? We dive deep into prompt optimization,
  exploring JEPA (Genetic Pareto) algorithm, how it works under the hood, and whether you can
  build your own optimizer. Live demo of a prompt optimizer built with BAML.
