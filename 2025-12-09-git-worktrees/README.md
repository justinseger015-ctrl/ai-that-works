# ai that works: Git Worktrees for AI Coding Agents

> Since ~ May 2025, there's been a ton of buzz around AI coding agents, parallelizing workflows, and it's not stopping any time soon. On this episode we'll go deep on the tech that can help you push the limits of these tools.

## Topics Covered

- Crash course on Git Worktrees
- File and Spec Management, tradeoffs in hardlinks vs symlinks
- tmux as a building block for collaborative agent workflows

## Episode Highlights

This one's gonna feel a little different but as always we'll do some deep technical diagrams, get hands on with the code, and give you actionable tricks you can use to get more (maybe even better?) results from AI tools.
