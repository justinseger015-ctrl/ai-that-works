title: "Prompting Is Becoming a Product Surface"
description: |
  Prompting used to be an engineering problem. Write the right string, tweak it until the model behaves, ship it behind the scenes.

  That breaks the moment real users show up. Customers don't think in prompts — they think in goals. They want to explain what they're trying to accomplish, not debug a magic sentence.

  So prompting is moving into the product. Interfaces matter. Structure matters. Guardrails and feedback matter. The real work now isn't prompt cleverness — it's building systems that let people express intent in a way software can actually understand and trust.
