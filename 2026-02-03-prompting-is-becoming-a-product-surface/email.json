  "body": "Hello First Name,\n\nThis week's \ud83e\udd84 ai that works session was all about \"Beyond the Magic Sentence: Prompting as a Product Surface\"!\n\nThe full recording, code, and diagrams are now live on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/hellovai/ai-that-works\n\nWe talked a lot about how to build product surfaces that turn user intent into structured AI outputs. Here's a quick rundown:\n\n*   **Prompting as a Product Surface, Not Just Magic Strings:** Remember how prompting used to feel like a backend-only thing? Well, it's really become a core part of the product experience. Users don't think in 'magic sentences'; they think about what they want to achieve (like 'set the temperature' or 'give me a bulleted list'). So, our focus needs to be on building interfaces that make that easy, with clear structure and helpful guardrails.\n\n*   **The 'Translation Layer' is Key:** We dove into the importance of a 'translation layer' (or dynamic schema generation). This is what takes user-friendly concepts \u2013 like picking an option from a dropdown for temperature or asking for a bulleted list \u2013 and turns them into the precise, structured prompts your LLM needs. It's how engineers keep control while giving users a lot of flexibility.\n\n*   **Separate Rendering Concerns:** A cool trick is to include display-specific attributes in your schema (like units or how things should be styled). These influence the UI but don't actually get sent to the LLM. It's a great way to optimize both the output quality and the user experience.\n\nIf there's one thing to take away from this session, it's this: Prompting isn't just about crafting a clever string; it's an engineered system. The real magic happens when you truly understand your customers and build a hybrid system that translates their goals into structured AI outputs, making their work easier and delivering precise results.\n\nNext up, next Tuesday, we're diving into \"Agentic Back Pressure\"! We'll explore how to get AI models to check their own work, optimize feedback loops, and integrate human-in-the-loop processes. This is super important for complex tasks where AI evaluation alone just isn't enough.\nSign up here: https://lu.ma/zcf5c8yd\n\nGot questions?
