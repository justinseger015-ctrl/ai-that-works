  "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nThis week's \ud83e\udd84 ai that works session was all about \"No Vibes Allowed: Live Coding BAML's WASM Bridge with AI That Works\"!\n\nThe full recording, code, and diagrams from the session are now available on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/hellovai/ai-that-works\n\nWe covered a ton, especially on building a new `sys_wasm` crate for BAML's WebAssembly integration using an agentic RPI workflow. Here's a quick recap of the highlights:\n\n**Structured Planning is Key:** We talked about how a structured RPI workflow (Research Questions, Research, Design Discussion, Structured Outline, Plan, Implement) keeps our research objective and our planning tight. This approach cuts down on endless back-and-forth with the AI, leading to much clearer and more reliable results.\n\n**Architectural Clarity, Even Without Code Reviews:** For big codebases, especially when you can't always do traditional code reviews, tools like auto-generated architecture diagrams and `cargo stow` are lifesavers. They help enforce dependency rules and keep the architecture clear, preventing hidden complexities and building a really solid structure.\n\n**Iterative Design with AI Prevents Flaws:** Chatting through iterative designs with the AI helps us spot and fix architectural flaws early on. This proactive approach means we get solid solutions in place *before* we even start coding, saving a ton of time and headaches later.\n\nIf there's one big takeaway from this session, it's this: AI engineering for complex systems is a multi-step journey. Your human architectural clarity and careful review at each stage are crucial for getting those robust, one-shot implementations. Remember, it's about guiding the AI, not just throwing prompts at it.\n\nOur next session will be next Tuesday at 10:10 AM PT. Stay tuned for the topic announcement!\n\nGot questions?
