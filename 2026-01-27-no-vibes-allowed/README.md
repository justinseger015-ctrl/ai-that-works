# No Vibes Allowed - Live Coding with AI Agents

> We received great feedback from our previous live coding sessions, so this week we are bringing it back by live streaming while we add more features to BAML. We have discussed a lot of topics over the past several months, and we will be digging into how to put many of these concepts into practice as we build out actual features in the product.
