Hello First Name,

First, we owe you an apology—we've been so focused on upgrading our recording setup for better video quality that we forgot to send out our usual episode emails! The good news: the new setup is working great, and we just hit 2,000 subscribers! Thank you for your support and patience as we level up the viewing experience.

SPECIAL EVENT: AI That Works Unconference - San Francisco (Oct 12th)

Join us IN PERSON for our first unconference! This is a participant-driven event where YOU help shape the agenda. Bring your hardest AI engineering problems, share what you're building, and collaborate with fellow practitioners.

Limited spots available: https://luma.com/ai-that-works-unconf


Here's what you missed:

Bash vs. MCP - Token Efficient Coding Agent Tooling (Watch) Context windows are precious. We explored when to use Bash vs MCP for coding agents, revealing how naming conventions and tool design can dramatically impact token usage and accuracy.

Evals for Classification (Watch) Building production AI isn't just about accuracy—it's about understanding what "correct" means for YOUR users. We built evaluation dashboards for 1000+ category classification systems and showed how to iterate quickly with real user data.

Dynamic Schemas (Watch) Stop hardcoding schemas. We demonstrated how to build UIs that adapt to any data structure using LLM-generated schemas and dynamic React components—perfect for building flexible extraction pipelines.


All code examples are available on GitHub.

Next Episode: Anthropic Post Mortem (Oct 7th)

Anthropic experienced some fascinating bugs in August and wrote an incredibly transparent postmortem. We'll dive deep into what went wrong, why it happened, and what we can all learn from their experience.
