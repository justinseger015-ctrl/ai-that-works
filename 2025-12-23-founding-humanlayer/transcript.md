Dex (00:01.538)
All right, we did it, we made it, we're live. What's up, y'all?

Vaibhav (00:05.197)
How's it going? It has been a while Dexter.

Dex (00:06.54)
I'm doing great. It's been, what did we talk yesterday for like an hour? It's been too long, you know.

Vaibhav (00:11.277)
It's been too long.

Dex (00:17.998)
I have a bit for you after the episode that I can't say on air, but I'm excited to share it with you.

Vaibhav (00:22.897)
that's even more exciting. Well, let's do a quick intro and then we'll get right back to talking about, think, one of my favorite topics this year. We do, this is AI That Works. For everyone that's joining, every week we try and talk about things about practical AI systems. We try and share code whenever possible. I'm Vylov, I work on BAML, and that's text.

Dex (00:31.819)
AI that works.

Dex (00:42.232)
Decks, I work on human layer.

Vaibhav (00:45.301)
And today we're probably not going to show real code as sad that as is we're going to talk about something really fun, which is just talking about Dextre himself and what he's been up to and how he's got to where he has his journey throughout the, throughout the last few years and just what the whole AI boom startup feelings have been. And also this YouTube channel that we started not too long ago.

Dex (01:07.778)
Yeah, what an adventure it has been. I saw something in the chat that the voice wasn't super loud. I'm not sure if that's me or you.

Can everybody hear us okay? It's good now. Okay, Cool dude. Yeah, I'm excited to chat a little bit. And just so y'all know, this is kind of our end of year special. So we're just gonna hang out and riff. this week I'm gonna tell my story and ViBov, I hope brought some good questions. And then we're gonna flip it next week and I'm gonna grill ViBov on his 12 pivots and why he left Fang and what it was like being a YC founder.

Vaibhav (01:20.063)
We'll find out in second. Okay. It sounds, it sounds to be good. Okay. Perfect.

Vaibhav (01:46.891)
But let's see you first. give the TLDR. What have you been up to? What have, how'd you get into the space? What did you do beforehand? Who the heck is Dexter?

Dex (01:48.694)
Yeah.

Dex (01:57.231)
All right, I'm gonna try to give the like 50,000 foot view. If I start dipping into a tangent, just kick me under the virtual table and tell me to like zoom out again. So I studied physics undergrad in college and realized quickly that academia was not for me. So I started taking a bunch of CS classes, cause the coolest guy I knew in college was really into CS and I wanted to work on projects with him.

Vaibhav (02:03.895)
Hahaha!

Dex (02:20.526)
So I got like half of a CS minor. That was enough to get a tech job. I worked at a company in Chicago called Sprout Social doing big data, social media analytics. I actually, I actually have a half of a CS minor. I didn't even get the whole thing. Yeah.

Vaibhav (02:28.033)
Wait, you didn't actually have a CS, you had a CS minor. I would have never guessed that from.

That's wild!

I just didn't expect that. Your code is actually way better than I would expect for someone with just a CS minor.

Dex (02:41.319)
I think we lost Vi-Bov or Vi-Bov lost me.

Alright chat, which one of us is frozen?

All right, I think we're back either way. Yeah, no, so yeah, I had taken a bunch of like Python engineering classes. I took like the core. I still think the best class, and this is where I'm gonna, you're gonna have to tell me to zoom back out, but yeah, the greatest class, the best programming language is actually not Rust. I believe it is Scheme.

Vaibhav (03:10.925)
Oh my God. Okay, I'm going to shut up and let you talk.

Dex (03:11.978)
We did the first class I ever took was functional programming and scheme with like, don't know if anyone used this thing called Dr. Rackett, which is like learning functional programming. had a bunch of built-in like image libraries so you could learn like anyways, we can zoom back out. So I did take a bunch of CS classes and then I just like.

learned on the job. think they had me on like bug squashing duty for the first like three or four months and I was just like am I ever gonna get a real I was just like going through and then like I remember there was one week where I just closed out like 10 tickets in like two days my boss was like all right you are now out of bug duty you can have a project now.

It's like, is that, when you started your job by Bob, like I've seen this in some places and I've seen some people do this really well, which is basically like, to get familiar with the code base, they just give you a stack of like, data dog errors or new relic errors and it's just like, go fix these one line changes until you're like, really proficient and competent in them.

Vaibhav (04:06.017)
Honestly?

Vaibhav (04:11.628)
So that's one way to do it. I have a different approach. What I've always done is I always really like plumbing tasks. like whenever we have someone join our team, we have a compiler. So I try and give them a pass that requires them to go all the way from the beginning, all the way to the end. Cause then they can actually learn the whole code base and be forced to do it. But you have to design it in a nice way or else they'll be very sad.

Dex (04:30.797)
Yeah, you almost have to put on your educator hat and build a curriculum for how do I learn this code base. Yep. So I that for two and a half years. I was there for a year, and then about a year in, I ended up going off. I'd always wanted to do startups, but for some reason, I am getting into this more of like...

Vaibhav (04:35.914)
Yeah. Okay. So you did Sprout Social. What happened after Sprout Social? How long were you there?

Dex (04:49.997)
But we got tapped, like the CEO had this crazy idea for like a side project and the CTO, were on like 2007 tech. like nothing was in AWS. It was all in rack space. Like it was just a little old. So the CTO wanted a greenfield place to test new technology. And the CEO had like an idea for a new product that was kind of related, but different enough that it could be its own brand. And so they like picked like five or six of us to go sit in the corner of the office and like work on. was like a secret project for like two months. And then they told everybody what we were working on.

but that was one of the most fun times in my career. Building a startup within a startup is like, you don't get startup equity, but you also don't have startup risk in that sense of like, if it doesn't work out, like I literally, worked on that project for like a year and then it was like, it was overstaffed. And so they just moved me back onto another team, no problem. You know what I mean?

Vaibhav (05:29.376)
Ha ha ha.

Vaibhav (05:41.322)
That is, you know, what's interesting I've had, there's another program in Google that's kind of similar to that, which is very similar to like, forgot the name of it where you don't think any of the risks, but you get to work on your own kind of idea for awhile. And they comp you like Google salary, but then you obviously get no equity for the same reasons.

Dex (05:53.707)
Yeah.

Dex (05:58.22)
Yeah, and this is different from 20 % time or whatever it is or is this what you're is because 20 % time is like

Vaibhav (06:02.302)
It's no, it's totally different. It's like a full-time job. I see you have a dog now too, that you, that is locally present. That's funny. you know, that's I'll let you unmute once you're there, but the one thing I'm really curious about is how do you, you transition from there? I think you're taking a second. I'll Well, sadly we're stuck here in a little pause. There you go. okay.

Dex (06:26.625)
I'm here, I can hear you. Sorry, what was the question?

Vaibhav (06:29.942)
So when you think about all that stuff, how do you think about it relative to like making the jump from a very stable job to then an unstable job? What was that first transition? How did you like, I'm guessing to some degree you must have known you wanted it.

Dex (06:45.003)
I think like even since college and this is a thing I think you have this thing you say a lot I've heard you say to lot of founders including me which is like you're building this plan in your head and you say like okay I'm gonna do this and then that's gonna let me do this and then at the end I'll be able to do this thing over here which is the thing I actually want and I think the advice that I've heard you and a lot of people say is like well just if you know the thing you want to be doing just go do that thing because you don't know how the steps are gonna work out and you don't know how the plan is gonna work out so it's like I have to do this so that then we can do this it's like

Just do the thing that you want because that's a hard problem and you don't understand it well and the best way to learn it and do it well is just to try to do that thing and not like try to like engineer this path to it kind of thing.

Vaibhav (07:26.784)
Yeah. So then how the next thing after that was replicated.

Dex (07:30.558)
So I actually worked at a FinTech company for about a year after that. I basically like in my head, was like, okay, I want to work at a tech company. So I got to learn like get good at engineering and get good at developer productivity. That was what I was super passionate about at Sprout. I just saw the best, most impactful engineer on the team was the guy who was like making the sandbox environments good, finding ways for people to deploy stuff, like just increasing velocity by making the developer experience internally really, really good. So I was just like, all right, that's really dope. I want to learn how to do that. So I joined this company called Aspiration.

which funny enough, I did not end up buying my options after I left like a year in. I won't go into too much detail, but I guess the founders are now in jail for defrauding their investors or something. So dodged a bullet on that one. I was there for about a year and then I went to join Replicated.

Vaibhav (08:11.371)
Hahahaha

Dex (08:18.933)
And the reason that I got really stoked about Replicate is they're doing like packaging stuff. They're building like a Docker container orchestrator. Again, like packaging and how you deliver software. I had always thought it was like a thing that was like, okay, cool. Like I applied for like an SRE job at Slack. I had like, was trying to join the developer productivity team at Netflix. Like I wanted to build developer tooling systems at massive scale. Yeah.

Vaibhav (08:37.951)
I mean, you love developer tools. Like I think it's probably just goes back to like just the kind of person you are. Like I think one of the first things that we bought on was just like talking deep about tech, talking about infrastructure stuff. And then also just, I think like trying to make other devs happy. Now I have a question for you. Yeah, I have a question for you. we obviously met, I think a little bit after your time at replicated, or was it right when you were leaving? I think it was a little bit after you had already left.

Dex (08:55.949)
It's really, really rewarding.

Dex (09:05.557)
No, you, yeah, let me, so we met at an AI Tinkerers event in Seattle.

I had been working on this thing called Metalytics, which was a startup that I started with my buddy in Chicago for about nine months. And it was like not working. My co-founder had left the company and I was like thinking about this. We had built this like AI agent that would help manage your like SQL data warehouse, like your snowflake or something. And we had like, well, this thing is going to be useful. There's a lot of tools out there that were like not super AI first, but they were very good in the sense of like, they would analyze all your traffic, all your indices, all your query speed. And it would be like, here's

Vaibhav (09:12.031)
Yes.

Dex (09:41.359)
Here's 10 recommendations, like add this index, stop querying this table in this way, drop this table because you're just writing to it and no one's ever reading to it. All this stuff. like, okay, what if we could have an agent that didn't just do recommendations but actually did the work for you? But I'm not gonna, yeah.

Vaibhav (09:56.428)
And just be clear for everyone else. This timeframe was 2024, if I remember correctly. Yeah.

Dex (10:02.572)
Yeah, we started the company in October, 2023 after I'd been at replicated for like seven years and done engineering and like go to market and solutions engineering and working with that. can tell that story, but yeah, that was when we met was we met in.

Vaibhav (10:14.571)
So that was like the earliest time people were doing agents. Like I think summer of 2024 roughly is when we met around this time.

Dex (10:19.946)
It was like Korea was getting really hot in like April, May, like Lang chain was starting to be like people were talking about it.

what I won't go into what people were saying about it in either direction, but it was getting a lot, a lot, a lot of popularity. I mean, I remember even in April, 2023 though, like the first AI demo I did, I was still at replicated and I was just like, I was like starting to think about like, okay, maybe I want to do a founder thing. I mean, I've always been thinking about it, but I had gotten to this point where like, maybe it's time I had done the product manager role there for like my last year. And in my mind, that was like the last skill set I wanted to be familiar with before I went and became a founder, which again was dumb. If you, if you want to be a founder, just go be a founder.

Vaibhav (10:32.043)
Ha

Dex (10:59.47)
because you'll learn all the stuff you need to learn. It'll be hard and you'll like stub your toe on a lot of stuff, but like you will learn it faster than if you do it the kind of more safe way of like, I'm at a 70 person startup and I'm gonna do product for a year and then I'm gonna do sales for a year and then I'm gonna do engineering for three years or whatever it is.

Vaibhav (11:00.427)
Bye.

Vaibhav (11:14.805)
I remember after we met, we had a really long conversation about your idea. I remember what I said about the idea, which is, this is a horrible idea. I love you as a person, but.

Dex (11:22.09)
You were like, is a really sick, yeah, you were like, this is like really sick Twitter demo, but I would never, I think you said like, I do some angel investing and I would never invest in this startup.

Vaibhav (11:30.889)
Yeah. But I did say you were a really cool person. I admire you. the idea was freaking dumb. At least in my mind. And I've thought a lot of things are dumb, to be fair.

Dex (11:38.293)
Yeah, it's good. Yeah, no, because...

So we built this agent and then we wanted to build this like human. We built a human in the loop permission system for it. We're basically like when the agent wanted to do something scary, we guaranteed that you would get pinged in Slack and then you could respond in natural language. should be like, you could be like, no, don't drop that table yet. I'm still, I need it for the board meeting. Or you could be like, yes, go ahead, drop that table. So it was like using natural language as a way of controlling these like really small points in a workflow. And so I built an API around that and I was like shopping it around and I was like thinking about pivoting. So I was doing like, you ever read that book, the mom test?

Where you guys just like go to every meetup, find everybody you think has this problem. Do not tell them what you're building and just ask them about their problems and try to figure out if you can decide if this is a thing that people actually want.

Vaibhav (12:21.077)
Okay.

Vaibhav (12:24.885)
So I'm gonna ask you a couple of questions really fast. Yeah, so just to describe everyone else, you had your main agent running over here, and then this was the original HumanLoop product. And then you had like the HumanLoop, HumanLayer, sorry, HumanLayer, you had the HumanLayer server, and basically your agent would just ask for permissions here. And I think the thing about it,

Dex (12:27.94)
we are gonna get whiteboards. Nice.

Dex (12:39.168)
Human Lair.

Dex (12:47.062)
Yep, and then HumanLayer server would go find a human in Slack or send them an email and they would go back and forth by then.

Vaibhav (12:51.883)
Exactly. And this would basically do like comms of some kind. Now the question I had for you, I think the reason I specifically didn't like this, and when you first presented this and when people are building AI ideas, I think it's really important that people really think about both the actual user flow and the developer flow. think specifically the thing I talked about was like, Hey, this agent thing, I think you were just running a polling process here until the server responded. And that's the part I was like, that is just not good. Uh, that was scary.

Dex (13:18.816)
Yeah, you have to make it sit. Yeah, you were the one who told me like you have to send a webhook back. And actually like I was talking to Dalton at YC and I was like, I got this feedback from ViBob. And he's like, well ViBob's super fucking smart. So if he asked you for something, you should probably go do that. Yeah.

Vaibhav (13:23.583)
Exactly.

Vaibhav (13:32.235)
So I have a question for you. Why, when you pitched this idea to YC, cause you pitched this to YC and you got in, why do you think you got in? Like what was the thing that got you in?

Dex (13:37.217)
Yeah.

So I did a couple mock interviews the day before and I talked to at least one person who had been at YC previously as not a group partner but as an administrator and her basic pitch was like, and she's awesome, her basic thing was like, I think this is a strong application, one, because it's AI safety focused. It's like, how do we get people to trust AI?

Two, was like, you just executed this, like, your co-founder left and in three weeks you, like, changed your domain, made a new website, shipped an MVP, flew out to San Francisco, pitched it to a bunch of people, like, closed your first revenue in, a week, a week after launching, and just like, okay, so clearly, like, even if this idea sucks, you can get shit done. As a solo founder.

And then I think the last, it was the kind of idea of like, okay, everyone at YC is building agents. If this is a good developer tool for agents, you can have a lot of affinity with selling into the batch and doing that kind of stuff. Quickly, I want to say something because, sorry, go ahead. Before we move on, I want to say something because I'm gonna forget otherwise.

Vaibhav (14:35.85)
Yeah. And just so everyone knows, like getting it. Yeah. I was gonna say like, just so everyone, just so everyone knows, like getting into YCSL is incredibly hard. And like I said, while this idea was absolutely ridiculous in terms of the way it was implemented, Dexter is one of the most impressive people I've ever met. And like, I, that's probably why he got in. Like, there's no doubt on that. But what's thing you want to say?

Dex (15:01.28)
So I also wanna say like the meta advice here is if you tell your idea to somebody and they tell you that it's shit, they might just be a hater, but there's a very good sign that they are a smart person that cares about you and wants you to be successful and they're gonna tell you the truth. So keep that person close.

And like, don't just write someone off because they don't get it. Like, I think working with like, showing you that and you giving me feedback was super valuable. And then us like going to a hackathon in November and building that like Discord chatbot where you're like, okay, I get how this could be really good. And that was also like, that was also the first time that we had, I had seen this like new way of built, like the way you built an agent was completely different than every framework I had ever seen. And it became that, like honestly that became the seed of

Vaibhav (15:33.198)
yeah.

Vaibhav (15:37.926)
It did change my perspective.

Dex (15:52.116)
the entire like philosophy of 12 factor agents. There was obviously a lot more to learn, a lot more to add, but yeah, like, I don't know. That's my advice. If someone shits on your idea, like, don't take it personally because, I mean, they may just be a hater, but like, if they're not, then like, keep that person close, because they probably want to help you.

Vaibhav (16:13.098)
I got a really funny bit of advice also from another person. They told me that apparently when you start up as haters, that's actually a good thing, because that means your startup somewhat matters and it drives emotional responses from people. Because if you have people that love you, then you should also have people that hate you fundamentally, because you're probably doing something a little polarizing in some dimension. So, yeah.

Dex (16:35.721)
Yeah, so we work a lot on Claude Code right now and I was pinging Tariq on Twitter a lot and I'm like, dude, also, here's my bug and it's been broken for a week and also, I don't know how you became the guy who people just bitch at on Twitter when Claude Code is broken, but props to you, man, that can't be an easy job and he said the same thing. He's like, if people aren't complaining, then your shit doesn't matter.

Vaibhav (16:58.602)
Exactly, I've got a question for you. So at some point you did the human letter thing, you did the thing you raised around. You were nice enough to let me put in a little bit of tiny money anyway, even though I said I would never invest in the idea. I did, because it turns out Dexter's too good to say no to. And then you did 12 factor agents. I think you were... Go ahead.

Dex (17:11.583)
Hahaha!

Dex (17:20.203)
Well, 12 Factor Agents was the product of like, think, and part of why, and like, you'll see this in the way we talk about AI a lot on this show and the way I talk about AI publicly, all the everywhere, which is like, there is a AI hype machine and like it drags a lot of people in and they get very excited about what's possible. But like there is a...

very good chance that if you found your way to AI, you have along the way ingested some bad faith hype. Some hype is real and it's exciting, I'm gonna share this with people, but some of it is just fricking grifters. And I'm not gonna name names and I don't even know, this is the same people who were really excited about NFTs and Discord five years ago or four years ago or whatever it is, but.

What I had learned basically was like...

Human layer was built on a thesis, which is like there is an AI agents ecosystem. There's frameworks and tooling. And if you can integrate into that tooling, this is like what a lot of AI dev tools did. You look at like ChromaDB, the way ChromaDB got, I mean, there's an awesome product and Jeff's fucking great, but also like they got a lot of distribution by just making an integration with crew, with Langchain, with Langgraph, with every single framework out there. And they made it really easy. Like if you are using this framework, you add one pip package and now you can use Chroma and it plugs into everything. And so the promise I

that was given to AI dev tools in the like spring, summer, fall of 2024 was there is an ecosystem. And if you build into this ecosystem, then you will have distribution and there's like a uniform interface. This is the same thing with like.

Dex (18:57.419)
I don't know, frickin' OAuth. If your service implements OAuth, then anyone can implement it into their site, right? And so this was kind of the idea, is like if you build against a standard, then you can implement one side of that interface, and then people can consume it with whatever tooling they want. And it makes it really easy for you to, what I found was, I went and talked to like 100 really good engineers, a bunch of YC founders, and I was like, tell me about your agent, your building agent. I wanted to talk to the people who actually had, not the indie hackers who were like all in on like the

the hype machine, they're awesome people and they're an important part of the community. And all these frameworks also have advanced the state of the art. But everybody I talked to who was actually making money in AI, who was selling six-figure contracts into real enterprises, they needed a lot of reliability. And the way they had found to do that was to do the things that we always talk about on this show, which is break down the problem and be pretty deterministic about it and think of LLMs as what they are.

like what they are really good at, which is turning structured data or unstructured data into other types of structured data. And that meant that they couldn't use any of these frameworks that were really opinionated about the loop and like took away a lot of control. And so I had built for this ecosystem and then I found all the people I actually wanted as customers in order to consume my service, everyone had different architecture. And so they would all need to like, like.

change their application architecture to fit into how human layer thought about the world and like we added the web host thing which was great for production but it also meant you had to really re-architect your application to be fully asynchronous where you fire off a tool request and then you have to stop save your state and then wait for a web hook to come back and so that was like 12 factor agents was my like I've been like I've been had

And like, I don't want other people to go through this same kind of journey of like, let me build for this ecosystem that is not actually how the top 1 % of builders are building.

Vaibhav (20:46.697)
I think when it came down to like tooling that happened in 2025, 2024, it's almost like this excitement that we all want, which says that in theory, if we all agree on a standard, it will just work and the puzzle pieces fit in perfectly and economies of scale and blah, blah, blah, blah. But in practice, it's that these puzzle pieces are so bespoke to our own businesses that they don't plug in with any other business because they're not designed to. And doing anything. Yeah.

Dex (20:51.583)
Yeah.

Dex (21:13.151)
Yeah, this is, I mean, I cited this paper. There's this Rails talk from like 2015 that was like, duplication is better than the wrong abstraction. And abstractions are powerful. And if you get the right abstraction, you can unlock a lot of value for both sides. But people were racing to create abstractions and a lot of them ended up being incorrect.

Vaibhav (21:24.318)
They're better.

Vaibhav (21:31.859)
So question on that topic. You did a talk about MCP recently. that plug into which, yeah, does that, how does that plug into this side of it? Which side of the abstraction there is it on?

Dex (21:37.59)
the MCP debate.

Dex (21:44.971)
I mean, so I think MCP is a very interesting interface. I think the thing that people got wrong about it, I think people are figuring this out now, but the thing that a lot of people got wrong about MCP for like the first six months, and I said this in the debate too, I think, I hope, is that like MCP is really good if you want to make your AI software extensible. What I saw tons and tons of people doing, and we even did a couple of workshops on this, was like, how do, like, if I'm building an AI application, I'm building the loop, I'm building the prompts, I'm defining the structured output, I'm defining the workflows.

And people were like, okay, instead of using SDKs, I'm going to use MCPs. Like I'm just going to have my model call the MCPs and the tool that it's like, if you know what the tools should be and you know what the workflow is, then like just write the dang code or just use the dang SDK. You don't need an extra layer of abstraction or MCP is cool. It's like, if you have an AI application, like a chat bot or something, then, and you want your users to be able to extend the functionality of that app. Then you build your app as an MCP client and you build a way for them to like paste in their MCP, JSON.

or put in a Streamable HTTP URL and now they've extended the functionality of less technical or just technical enough to know I paste URLs in and now I get my Gmail as auth or whatever it is.

Vaibhav (22:58.557)
Yeah, I think it's a, it's a great client application, a poor server service effectively. We can talk. Yeah.

Dex (23:04.926)
Well, and like we were probably not going to supposed to talk about the future today, but the skills stuff is I'm very excited about how to see how skills unfold in 2026. I think what is different now that was not what is true now that was not true in November of 2024, I think, whenever whenever MCP came out.

Vaibhav (23:11.24)
Yeah.

Dex (23:23.772)
is that we have like huge product market fit for coding agents and coding CLIs. We did not have that a year ago. And now we have that. And that means that like the easiest way to connect your agent to external services is no longer some API, some like very heavy, lots of different features and lots of different like prompts and workflows and tools and all these different things. It's like, no, the easiest way to connect your agent to services is

file systems and bash commands. Now, bash commands are not very safe. Like they're much more, the MCP is safer than just giving your model batch, but the idea of like the file system as the substrate for this and then skills is literally just like a markdown file in a folder or in a tar.gz and then whatever else you want, you can bundle CLIs and stuff with it as well. But it's a very interesting like.

I would be very bullish on skills over MCP and I've seen companies building non-coding, non-technical start, like startups for business people, for salespeople, for administrators, for ops people that are AI agent startups that are built with at their core, they have Claude Code SDK or Claude Agent SDK because it's just a good tool calling loop and they find ways to take the external data like your Gmail or your calendar or whatever it is and pull that into the file system rather than trying to connect

every single different API into the agent. And so skills is a really interesting, I'm excited to see where that goes. And I'm actually probably gonna work on a couple skills. We have a bunch of skills we use internally. I wanna make some open source ones, maybe over the holidays.

Vaibhav (24:59.944)
I mean, your skills and prompters are some of the best that I've seen. I've slowly been seeding them across my whole team and other people I meet. And they're just phenomenal. Cause I think it just goes down to it. We talked about this in the prompt optimization episode yesterday, which is, is your, is, is the prompt optimizer going to be better than your best engineers? Definitely not. Is a prompt optimizer going to be better than, uh, your part of the code that you never look at, but once a hundred percent. Yes. think it's the same thing.

Dex (25:24.062)
you don't care about, yeah.

Vaibhav (25:25.988)
It's standing with these kinds of tools. like, for example, like I'm spending zero time writing my actual cloud code, like agents on MD or everything else. And because, the reason I don't is that my code base is changing too fast for me to keep that properly in sync. But the RPI method that you came up with and the prompts that you have for the RPI method specifically all revolve around this idea of you store no information about the actual system. And every single time you do a task, you build that context up individually for that system and that research plan implements technique.

just works really well. It's actually, if you think about how docs are, docs quickly become out of date. And there's these whole startups trying to say that, Hey, we'll just keep your docs up to date. But that actually way worse than just like, screw it. I'll just run an agent loop and just build up all the contacts constantly every single time.

Dex (26:09.961)
I'm going to show one slide from the AI engineer talk that is, I don't think, I'm guessing you didn't have time to watch the talk yet, but.

Vaibhav (26:12.124)
Please.

Vaibhav (26:22.066)
I skimmed it, so go on though. I watch at 2x speed, that's why I said that.

Dex (26:24.937)
Okay, Okay, what is on the y-axis between the actual code, the names of your functions, the comments in the code, and then the code-based documentation that you maintain for developers and internal users? What do you think is on the y-axis of this chart?

Vaibhav (26:45.672)
source of truth.

Dex (26:48.809)
It's actually the amount of lies. Which is the inverse of source of truth, yeah, basically.

Vaibhav (26:50.476)
yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes. Sorry. That's what I meant. Yes. I agree. That is exactly true. That is, that is why I think the RPA method works so well. You just read the code and you analyze it. So

Dex (27:04.681)
It's scrappy. I mean, it takes a little longer. You're to burn a couple extra tokens. But like if you can figure out how to background that stuff and paralyze it, it's very predictable what the outcomes are going to be. Like when I do a research, I know exactly what kind of doc I'm going to get out. I know exactly what I'm looking for. And so you can do three or four of them in parallel, even for one task. can be like, cool, tell me how this part of the code base works. Tell me how this part of the code base works and this. And you get your three research documents and you kind of know what they're going to do. And it's so reliable. I, most of the people I know who have been doing this for a month or two, like they barely read the research anymore because the prompt is so reliable. You know,

it's gonna just go find how the code base works today and assemble your documentation. So if you can find something to do for 10 minutes while the researchers, five to 10 minutes while the researchers are running, then it's, think, is the single best way to like seed an agent. Whether you go do plan implement or, I've often just used a research and then launched a new session, but here's the research, here's the like one line change I want you to make. Like you can use it to seed your vibe coding session too.

Vaibhav (28:00.167)
Yeah. I mean, I, I've been, I have a, I think a 15,000 line PR, that I'm working on right now off of this recess. I'm adding rust support for BAML and the whole thing is pure RPI. and it works really well. I've had to hand write a couple of code. but I just, yeah, exactly. But most of it is RPI all the way through.

Dex (28:10.013)
Hell yeah.

Hell yeah.

Dex (28:16.553)
That's normal. Like the goal of RPI is not to perfectly one-shot a long complex task. It's to speed you up by 2 to 3x.

Vaibhav (28:27.642)
Exactly. And it does involve like, we'll talk about this a little bit later, actually. So as you're building out this company, now you're building out code layer, and you're sharing it. And I think a few people have private beta access. Hopefully everyone that's watching and wants to watch these kinds of content is able to get data access pretty fast. But

Dex (28:44.829)
Yes, if you send me, if you sign up for the waitlist and you send me an email, I'll shoot you access or ping me on the Boundary Discord and I'm around or come to the HumanLayer Discord. Yeah. Okay. Where are we on story? What are the, what are the, what are the gaps still? Cause we're getting back into like building. Yeah.

Vaibhav (28:51.836)
Yeah, both are really good. And then if you.

Well, that's the thing I want to know about how, so you started building code layer. you've done a lot of talks now by agentic engineering to the whole thing. I want to know, it's like, how did you go from being a solo founder to now you have this amazing co-founder Kyle. How did that happen? How did you meet him? Where is he? where is he like, where is he in the picture?

Dex (29:05.576)
Well.

Yeah.

Dex (29:14.887)
Yeah.

Dex (29:22.299)
Yeah, so I mean, rewind a little bit because there's a gap in the story here, which is like, okay, we did human layer, talked to all these founders, figured out that it like, everyone was either gonna have to like re-architect their app to use it, or like, I was gonna have to help them build their agent in a new way.

So we started doing a bunch of experiments. kept HumanLayer going. We had some customers that were fans and was helping them ship faster, but it was like, didn't have PMF. was like most people I talked to, were just like, okay, cool, I'm gonna have to do a bunch of stuff. by the time, the cost of changing the code was like they could probably just build the parts of it that they needed. So that is not PMF.

Vaibhav (29:59.676)
Yeah.

Dex (30:00.455)
And so we did a bunch of experiments. built this like Kubernetes orchestrator for AI agents. We built this thing that I still think is dope that I haven't seen out there, which is like a, MCP agent, like a, that is email based. like you put in your MCP, JSON, and you get back an email address. And then when you send an email to that address, it is an agent that has access to all your MCP servers and it like can email back and forth with you. you can say something like forward emails for boomers. know, but the thing that made it click for people I talked to was like, it's for delegation.

You get something in your inbox and you forward it to this agent, you're like, add this to my to-do list or update the CRM with this conversation or whatever it is. It was like this perfect...

Vaibhav (30:36.667)
Yeah, it's, it's kind of no different than like me telling cursor or Claude code or any of these agencies like tasks from Slack. It's super helpful to be able to delegate from the comm software I use every day.

Dex (30:48.777)
Yeah. So yeah, it's like anymore for that. And then we started working also when the cloud code SDK came out and like sonnet, I think it was like sonnet four and opus four came out.

and the Claude code SDK came out. This was before Opus 4.1, but there was this way to now run Claude code headless and it had this JSON interface over standard out. And so we started hacking on like, okay, this is cool, this is new tech, this is gonna be important. And so we just built a bunch of stuff. We built an integration where you could run Claude code headless and it would email you when it was done and then you could respond to the email and send another user message to it. so you could interact with Claude code over your email or over Slack or something. We built this in May.

And then we started building this like terminal UI of like, hey, if I want to manage a bunch of cloud code sessions and just see which ones have like need permission from me and be able to interact with them in like a more global. It was like basically like everyone had prototyped all this crazy like Tmux and work tree stuff. And I was like, okay, what would it look like to like productize this workflow and make it accessible to people who were not like terminal power users and had been like living in Tmux for the last 10, 15 years.

And so we hacked on that and we like, and then we started doing using RPI because we were talking to Claude all day, we were building tools on top of Claude. We were like.

using the early versions of the RPI prompts to actually develop this tool. And so it this big Golang daemon and like manage all these clod sessions, all kinds of crazy stuff. And so like in parallel, we were building this product that helped you like parallelize clod and use it better. And then we were also like building this workflow that we used internally. And I'll say like the day that made me decide, cause we were in experiment mode. had like two or three different experiments going in parallel and we're trying and we were getting like doing discovery. And the day that made me decide, okay, we need to go all in on like code layer and RPI.

Dex (32:35.306)
It was actually the day you and me sat down at my apartment and we just like hacked on shit for like seven hours Because I remember you were like, okay, I want to learn this stuff. And so you were sitting next to me and I was feeding you each prompt one at a time. You're like, okay, cool. I finished the research. What's next? I'm like, okay, cool like paste you in slack. Here's the create plan prompt like do this. I think we got like

45 minutes in and you basically like you were like I don't think this is gonna work for like I could have made this fix in 15 minutes and I'm still in the planning phase and the plan is wrong and like I Don't think this is gonna work for our code base remember this

Vaibhav (33:07.515)
Yeah, I said that. do remember that. was actually, mean, fundamentally, I think I changed as a software engineer that day. Because like, I just didn't believe in AI coding. I'm a pretty fucking fast coder. I'm a pretty fast coder. Please cut that out, Mario. I'm a pretty fast coder.

Dex (33:19.174)
You're fast coder and you're incredibly fastidious also. Like you really, really care about every single token in the code base.

Vaibhav (33:27.855)
Yeah, I want it to be good and clean because like a clean code is maintainable code and you can't build a company if your system isn't maintainable, especially not a compiler tool chain company. Like we need to make sure that it doesn't work. So like when we showed, I just hadn't trust seen AI really impressed me before that day. And then we implemented abort controllers. And so we have like a board to demo now. And I mean, the wasm, which we saw in merge, but there's a new stuff that is going to make this easier. But we did all that work and it just.

Dex (33:52.006)
Yeah, and you can always just rebase the plan on top of your current code base. But yeah, sorry, keep going.

Vaibhav (33:55.975)
Uh, the code base changed a lot in a better way, in a way that'll make it easier to do, but that's a separate thing. But I think that whole workflow just fundamentally changed the way I was like, Oh, and I remember this very distinctly because originally when I was driving, I actually couldn't make it work. What was really interesting is in that shift that we had, we actually did something, which was when I said it, I don't believe this will work.

Dex (33:58.821)
Okay. Hell yeah.

Vaibhav (34:19.867)
What Dexter says was, why don't you let me take over the computer and you just tell me what we should do. And he said, pick two really hard problems.

Dex (34:24.978)
I actually think it was your idea. In my memory, you're like, why don't you drive and show me how you do it?

Vaibhav (34:30.661)
Yeah, something like that. just like, this clearly isn't working for me. And you tried it. And then you started typing and talking to the computer. And then I think halfway through you were like, why don't you just talk to the mic and talk into that instead? Cause like Dextro was saying some stuff that was just incorrect about our code base. Cause he doesn't know the code base, rightfully so. and I just.

Dex (34:44.552)
Yeah, no you would say something and then I would try to repeat it into super whisper to give it to Claude and you're like no no no that's that's wrong and I was like alright cool like here's the mic you say it and that was yeah that's the thing when I pair with other people I try to unlock that moment because I think that's that's a really powerful like Where you realize that like you are the codebase expert

Vaibhav (34:51.398)
Yeah.

Vaibhav (35:03.803)
Yeah, I.

Dex (35:07.888)
If you want to learn this stuff or you want to teach this stuff, you have to have in the room, you have to have a code-based expert with lots of opinions and lots of knowledge, and you have to have a workflow expert, someone who's been doing this RPI stuff for a while and knows how to sprinkle in the magic words and all this kind of stuff.

Vaibhav (35:21.297)
Yeah. And then we did that and like, it just works. like it works really freaking well. and I guess that's the day that you went all in.

Dex (35:28.828)
That way, when I was like, remember like high-fiving and we got the Wasm thing working in the browser. We had to like vibe out the last like 10 % of it or whatever. And you were like, this is sick. I think I should like figure out how to get my team to adopt this. And I was like, okay, cool. If this works for ViBog, the most anti, like cynical on AI coding, one of the best engineers I know, then like this is a thing we should invest in figuring out how to bring to more people.

Vaibhav (35:33.777)
Yeah. Yeah.

Vaibhav (35:54.981)
And then you built ColdLayer. And I remember...

Dex (35:57.171)
Code layer, I mean we used code layer that day to do it, but it was like, was an experiment category along with a couple other experiments. that, yeah, it was trash.

Vaibhav (36:01.786)
Yeah. And there was a lot more bugs back then than there are way more now. was like the earliest days. Yeah. and then I guess at that point you brought on Kyle, not too long after that.

Dex (36:13.232)
So yeah, so Kyle I had met like back in like May or June as Kyle likes to joke I was gonna try to get him on today, but he's like traveling with his in-laws in Rome right now So we'll get him on to do he can tell his side of the story at some point next year But yeah, we had met and as Kyle likes to joke his his previous CEO made the tactical error of introducing us

Cause we just ended up chatting and hanging out and like did a couple hackathons, not even like working on the same stuff, but just like hanging out. And I was just like so impressed with the stuff he was building and how not only how fast he could build stuff, but also like design and like visually it was very tasteful and like good looking, which is rare in like someone who has like a ton of, and like also he went straight for the hardest problem. Like he was like, cool, I'm going to solve this thing that is not well documented anywhere, which is like, I'm going to figure out how to like do delegation between like a midstream OAuth provider and an upstream OAuth.

provider and build this identity model that is not really exists in the world as a standard yet. I was like, this is cool as hell. So I just basically, started trying to RPI pill him just because I just wanted more people. This was within weeks of us doing this day. was like, I'm going to try to get more people to do RPI. Go check out the GitHub repo and run code layer on your workstation and stuff.

And then by the time I was like, Kyle, you should come join us and like, like, like almost like get to the like, Hey, look, like, I think you'd be a great co-founder. He had already been doing RPI and using code layer for like a month and a half. and so, and like, he was a big fan of our content. He's been, I've been watching AI that works for a while. He jumps on and like, we'll share his thoughts on certain things as we go. He's just one of the best engineers I've ever met. He works so hard. He cares so much. And so like, I had to ask like six or seven times.

But eventually he said yes. So I don't know if there's advice buried in there, but just like build a thing that people love and that will attract great talent who want to, yeah.

Vaibhav (38:09.648)
So when it comes to getting a co-founder, I'm always curious about this, especially for solo founders out there. What do think you said to them that made them convert? Like how do you convince someone? Because at this point you had already raised capital, you'd gone through YC. So a lot of the solo founder part was hard. How did you make that work on both your ends to make it exciting and valuable for him?

Dex (38:35.975)
Ask that question a different way. I mean, I'm curious like what's your underlying question?

Vaibhav (38:39.43)
Like what, do you think you said? Well, that's what mean. Like what did you think you said to him that made him want to jump, jump and do this? Cause he obviously had a great gig at his old place. He moved cities, uh, the common D or co-founder. That's an easy conclusion that someone comes to. And for a lot of solo founders out there, I've met a lot of people that are incredibly talented. And I remember when I've, when we started chatting about this kind of stuff, like maybe like a year ago now, I was like Dexter, find a fricking co-founder.

Dex (38:52.359)
Yeah.

Vaibhav (39:09.442)
If you do nothing else, just find a freaking code founder. It is the most important thing you do. And.

Dex (39:14.683)
And I worked really hard. Like the first half of 2024 was, or 2025 was like a lot of work trials, a lot of like working closely, bringing someone on for like six weeks who was super senior and incredible engineer. Like there were so many people where it was like almost right, but there was like one thing that wasn't working.

Vaibhav (39:31.344)
Yeah. So what, what was it in eventually where you're like with pile, you just knew because you did a way less shorter. I mean, you did a similar lead land trial, but you kind of knew much sooner than you did with almost everyone else that we check. Yeah. You just kind of, yeah.

Dex (39:42.907)
No, we didn't do any work trial. mean, like I had seen, we did one hackathon together and then we did another hackathon. We were just like in the same space working on different things.

Vaibhav (39:52.223)
That's what I mean. Like, what was the difference? So for everyone that's trying to find a co-founder, how did you know that Kyle was going to be the right fit?

Dex (40:01.063)
I'm gonna give you, I'm gonna spit you back your favorite answer, vibes. You just can tell when someone is built the same way as you and cares as much as you and like thinks about problems in the same way, but also like brings a ton of skills that balance out skills that I don't necessarily, I mean I have, but I'm like a seven or an eight out of 10 on and Kyle's like an 11 out of 10.

Vaibhav (40:25.029)
That's right. That's just so everyone knows that is Dexter's minimum on every skill he has ever acquired. A seven or eight. Everything else is a ten. But I'm joking. No, I'm joking. Yes, I'm just joking. I'm teasing it. But I think that's, that makes a lot of sense. I think it's a lot of people push really hard to like try and become funner to someone because they're trying to like force something to work. But honestly, like when you're working with someone, you can often just, it's the same with like a higher or something else.

Dex (40:31.687)
No, I'm sure there's something on the 3-ed.

Dex (40:48.252)
Yeah.

Vaibhav (40:53.381)
When you're really doing it, it's so easy to just be like, is this a great fit? Are you super excited about it? Would you? I think the best analysis is like, would you fight someone else if they said no to bringing this person on? And if you would fight someone else and be like disagreeing, like argue on behalf of that person, it's going to be a great thing. It's very easy to recognize that extreme sensation versus the, they're like pretty good. And it feels very different.

Dex (41:15.633)
They're pretty good, but I'm not 100 % sure and like it could probably work out, but I don't know. It's just like, that's, if that's your feeling, then like you already know your answer.

Vaibhav (41:19.65)
Exactly. Yeah.

Vaibhav (41:24.613)
Yeah, exactly. Okay, so you're doing that stuff. What's next? You've got 2026. I know.

Dex (41:29.639)
we're building so much exciting stuff. Yeah, so I mean, I think like candidly and openly like code layers are really no product that people who love code layer like love code layer. Like we get notes all the time from people like this has changed my entire workflow.

And I think the next thing we have to unlock is like, we were working with a bunch of design partners right now, like trying to build this into orgs with 45 engineers, hundred engineers, 3000 engineers. And like there's different kinds of problems at every one of those scales. Like for a 45 engineering team, you can just be like, fly out all your tech leads. I'll train each of them like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. And then they can go home and spread the learnings to like each to like three or four people. And that actually works pretty nicely. And they can start to figure out how to customize it for their org. For 3000 person org.

like there's no point in me like doing, trying to train everybody. And so part of it is like, how do we enable our champions and the people in those companies who love RPI to actually do like, actually like build artifacts and documentation so that any developer who wants to learn this can show up our TFM, like try it for a couple of days and like get reasonably good results. So the two things that we're like really focused on solving in the future are like number one is like the collaboration thing isn't

Vaibhav (42:18.757)
Yeah.

Dex (42:47.024)
fully solved yet. We talk about, these research and plans are great artifacts for mental alignment. There's a lot more refinement there in terms of splitting plan documents into like a high level doc for mental alignment and then the low level doc with every code change that is really should just be reviewed by the engineer like working with the model. And then there's another thing we found is like, as the harnesses change and the models change, the level, the, you know, one to a hundred score of how good is your instruction following is

It vacillates throughout the day based on your prompts, based on your code base. And what we found is like someone I sit down with for seven hours can get good results from planning all the time. But when they go and give it to their teammates, if they don't sit with those people for seven hours, which honestly, who has time for that? Like if you have to teach me it for seven hours, like there's some product stuff to do there.

Vaibhav (43:34.981)
and most people are just on ground learning.

Dex (43:37.351)
So we're gonna have this thing I call like auto-tune for planning or guided planning, which is a lot more, it basically is like we're taking the 12, it's funny, because I was the 12 factor agents guy, right? It was like full fat agents don't work, don't just do tools in a loop, think of it as a structured workflow, think of microagents as part of a deterministic dag, and then like two months later we were really obsessed with Claude Cote, it was like, oh yeah, the agents don't work, but this one's pretty fucking good.

And like, can get a lot of really good results from it just because like the models got better and things like that. And now we're getting this point where it's like, okay, to break through the barrier and like guarantee good performance, we actually have to untangle this, you know, the planning prompt is five high level steps. Each step has like five to 10 instructions in it. And it's just a lot for like, if you want to use Sonnet, Sonnet cannot build a plan using that prompt because it'll get halfway through step two and then it will forget what it was doing. You have to like remind it where we were.

And so we're finding is like, if we can chunk that prompt up and rather than using prompts for control flow, like if the user says this, do this, if the user says that, do that. If the code base looks like this, do this. We could actually chunk it up into smaller workflow steps and use control flow for control flow, which is the whole point of 12 factor agent. So it's a fun like opportunity to marry these ideas together. I'm really excited to share kind of what this work. It's an early prototype. We're using it to build our own plans now. And I really, really like it. And then the other side is Vigma for Cloud Code.

Vaibhav (44:57.253)
So how do I get access?

Dex (44:59.078)
I can send you a compiled bun binary that is a CLI prototype. Yeah.

Vaibhav (45:06.025)
Send it. I'll try it. I love trying early things. I think it's one of the things that I try and do specifically because the more early things I try, just the better, the better we can understand how people want to build AI pipelines long-term.

Dex (45:20.102)
Yeah.

And the other thing we're doing is we basically like re-architected code layer from scratch and are rebuilding it from the ground up. We're keeping all the UI and the experience stuff and the hotkeys and everything that everybody loves, but we're rebuilding it to be collaborative so that when I launch a session in code layer, I can send my coworker a link to it and we can both have code layer open and both watch the same cloud session streaming and we can leave comments on it. And like, if I'm driving on my machine, you can just like right click on a message and like suggest, Hey, we should prompt it this way. And then I can accept your prompt. And so we can co prompt instead of

Vaibhav (45:40.613)
That's cool.

Dex (45:51.26)
you having to talk into the mic or like tell me over the call and I try to transcribe it.

Vaibhav (45:53.637)
That's cool. It's kind of like it's kind of like VS code live share, but,

Dex (45:58.171)
It's like VS Code Live Share, but for coding agents, yeah. So, and a lot more depth there, but that's what I'm able to share right now. So we're really excited about that and excited to share it with the community in early 2026, yeah.

Vaibhav (46:01.068)
Exactly. That's freaking sick. That's sick.

Vaibhav (46:08.909)
Okay.

Vaibhav (46:12.484)
I've got a, can I ask you a couple of hard questions now? Okay. So people, if you have questions to Dexter, put down in the chat. If you're watching on anywhere but Riverside, sorry, you'll find the Luma page and you can go on there and ask questions over there. If you have questions, feel free to ask. while we get, while we see if we have any of those, I've got a question for you Dexter. You're operating in a very, very crowded space. As a founder,

Dex (46:15.568)
We could do hard questions, we could do questions from the chat. I'm good with either.

Dex (46:37.966)
yeah.

Vaibhav (46:39.768)
How do you navigate that? Like how do you wake up? do you get your team excited? How are the lows? Because the lows must be very intense in this space.

Dex (46:47.162)
The lows are off. I mean, it's like, think there's a lot of founders go through this. Like every time you check social media, one of your competitors who is already way further along than you publish something really dope that makes them look really good. Well, they published a new feature and you're like, fuck, I thought I was the only one who was thinking about building that. And like, you know, we, shipped RPI and now every single agenda coding API ID has a plan mode. I'm not sure they are all as good as RPI planning. think I still think RPI planning is the state of the art, but,

So yeah, especially in a very crowded space, it's very, very, especially just anything in AI, it's very easy to like compare yourself to every other company. And you just kind of have to like find a way to balance that out. The thing I love doing, the thing that works the best, it's not just for building a business, it's like for your own mentality is like talk to customers all the time.

Every time you build something new, get on the call with someone that you already know who's a friendly and show them the thing that you're doing or show it to a new person. Like I try to have at least a couple onboarding calls on my calendar every single week for people who sign up for the wait list. And then I send them a link, they schedule a call and I watch them use the product.

because I see them use a brand new feature we shipped last week. You constantly want to be watching people use your product because it's two-sided. It's the this too shall pass thing. I don't know if you've heard about this, this old story of like the magic ring that makes you feel when you're really feeling up, it brings you back down to earth. And when you're feeling really shitty, it kind of brings you back to the middle.

And it was a magic ring. It was just a ring that had the words, this too shall pass on it. It's some like Talmud story or something. Anyways, yeah, the idea is watching people use your product will one, remind you how dope it is and how unique it is and how much people like it. And it will also make you hate everything about your product. And you'll see all the bugs that they don't really see and like, fuck, we got to fix that. We got to fix that. And so like, it's very balancing to get out of the world of social media and hype and buzz and podcasts and all this stuff and just build a thing and watch people use it.

Vaibhav (48:32.598)
Or vice versa.

Dex (48:48.167)
If you have a customer that you're really excited about, like meet them every single day, talk to them, find out what their biggest problem is, solve that, ship it the next day, meet them again, see what the new biggest problem is. And if you can get that cycle going, if you can like minimize the time of iteration between build feedback, build feedback, you don't care about any of other stuff because you're so excited and you know you're solving real problems for real people.

Vaibhav (49:15.108)
Yeah, I think that's honestly one of the most understated things. Like most, I think a lot of people don't recognize this, but like most startups suck on day one. Like you see all these stories of, we went to a zero to a hundred million ARR in like nine months or six months. And like there may be companies like that, but frankly speaking, like statistically out of all the companies in the world, there's a lot that make a lot of money to bring a lot of value that don't have that track and they all still win. Um, and I think it's very easy to talk about the super like super outliers.

But oftentimes the biggest companies are not the ones that go do that. There are companies that just have like nonstop continuous growth every single day. That said, it is hard. It is very, very hard.

Dex (49:56.046)
Also, you could do something like, you could work on something open source and free and work on it for 10 years and then one day start charging for it and you already have distribution to everyone's use. And then, yeah, that's how you go from zero to 100 million ARR in nine months is you already have a million users.

Vaibhav (50:04.162)
Yeah. And people hate you. Well.

Vaibhav (50:14.552)
Well, mean, Docker did that and Docker struggled a lot. A lot of open source companies have tried that and they've gotten a lot. Sure. Yes. We've got a question from Dustin. When you pivoted away from the original human in the loop tech, were you focused on coding use cases only? I'm wondering what you think other markets are like Upwork, Uma, that orchestrate agents and humans to accomplish tasks. Did you ever consider those ideas?

Dex (50:18.501)
Docker made other mistakes, but yeah.

Dex (50:40.099)
I mean, yeah, the idea with HumanLayer's API was was like the first person who paid for HumanLayer was building a marketing bot.

And so he had built this system that would like scrape hacker news and find the top because he wanted to like, was, was, he was helping developers market their tech. He had like an agency. And so like, where did developers go when they want to market their shit? They go to hacker news and they post on show agent. So he would crawl the top posts on show HN. He would like did a browser agent that would go like search for all this stuff. He kind of hacked some of this together and like, we worked on it together and like took the NNN workflow, moved it to crew AI and then deep tangled the crew AI workflow into something else. But at the end of day, it was like, I found this, the message.

that came into his Slack was like, I found this person, here's the email I'm gonna send them. And he had the option to either approve it and the email would go out or to deny it and give it feedback. Either like that person's not relevant or that's good but it sounds too much like AI like say this instead. So like, yes, it was for sure the idea was like, I wanted cursor tab autocomplete but for like everything in life. was explicitly not for coding at that time.

Vaibhav (51:40.792)
I think the question Dustin is asking is like, there's another way where you could have built a human loop company almost like a, almost like a combined pager duty kind of thing where you're like, Hey, every time something comes in, you as a, you kind of bind the humans and agent together and you become like a processing layer for that to like guarantee something happens. What made you pivot away from that kind of idea? Yeah.

Dex (52:00.101)
Yeah.

No, we talked about it like PagerDuty. We talked about it like PagerDuty a lot, which was like, Hey, look, you're going to want different humans. Like the, the metaphor was always like, Hey, you have a sales outreach bot and you put four, four salespeople in a channel. And like, it's, it's every time it wants to send an email, human looks at it, which means, I don't know, I, we all get too much like email marketing spam and shit like that. I was like, you can actually have really good messages go out if you let humans review them that have all the context and stuff like that. And it was like, yeah, you have whoever's on call and then you can escalate through and escalate to the manager. like your goal.

was like, your agent says, I need an approval on this, and we would figure out who it was, find the right person. We had this thing where we would like rag against a database of your people and like what skills they had and then like try to serve up, here's the three people that can help with this and then ask each of them in a, in series. So yeah, that's exactly kind of the idea. And it turned out that like,

Vaibhav (52:47.256)
Yeah.

Dex (52:50.991)
people just hadn't architected their applications in a way that was ready for that. And I saw the path to make human layer work and it was like, create an open standard for human approval and human in the loop, get everybody to adopt it. And I was just like, that's just gonna be a lot of work in a long time where we're not actually delivering a lot of value to anybody. And then at the same time we had stumbled on this code layer thing and this RPI thing and I was like, this feels like a much more fun business to build.

Vaibhav (53:16.865)
Yeah, think Dustin, when it comes to pivoting, like honestly, you just kind of go with the gut and likely when most people are in pivot hell, what I find is they're actually not tied to any one idea. They're almost simultaneously thinking, hedging on every idea and like you just find the one that gets you the most dopamine and you just follow that all the way through as far as you can.

Dex (53:37.654)
man, I can't wait to hear more about that story next week when we talk about your, what was it, 12 pivots?

Vaibhav (53:45.443)
Um, uh, yeah, uh, SSS, the reason they're asking about, and we can set this out of the clip, but SSF, the reason that, yeah.

Dex (53:51.373)
Yeah, don't answer this on stream. Well, alright, just take this out of the clip.

Vaibhav (53:56.855)
Yeah.

Dex (54:00.281)
Just ask me in the Discord later, I will explain it.

Vaibhav (54:00.566)
The reason, yeah, just if, if you want access for it, uh, just ask on discord. And the reason is really just what Dexter alluded to here in order to make a really good product, especially one as nuanced as like a coding agent that's going at things differently. It's incredibly useful for people to just get an idea for what it's like and for Dexter to recognize what, Hey, what are the areas that we can improve? So that onboarding is beautiful and amazing for every single person. Like that sort of experience is, uh, undoubtedly going to make the product better long-term.

Whereas if you just give a product to everyone, I can't you the number of products that I've tried and like the founders are just not responsive enough. And I just churn off because it doesn't actually make my life better in a way that's substantial. It's like another thing I have to manage.

Dex (54:44.43)
I don't know if that's necessarily advice, it depends on what you're building, but like, yeah, make sure the experience is really, really good and figure out who it solves problems for, because if you give it to a bunch of people that are like not the right target user, you're just gonna have a bunch of people out there in the world who people are gonna be hey, did you try this thing? And they're be like, yeah, I tried it, I didn't get it. And that's not what you want when you're trying to get a product off the ground.

Vaibhav (55:01.123)
Yeah.

Yeah, Dextra, I've got another question for you. Last one. What are you most excited for next year?

Dex (55:10.532)
We're gonna ship so much cool shit, dude. We're gonna ship a lot of stuff. I'm excited to see how skills unfolds as a standard for agent skills. I'm excited to see what new models we get and where we can push the frontier. And I'm excited to get a huge chunk of really good developers to the point where they can ship 2 3x faster with AI.

Vaibhav (55:31.701)
I am also very excited for all those things and excited to see you hopefully when next year.

Dex (55:36.964)
Yeah man, this is gonna be sick. Alright, this was fun. Thanks everybody in the chat. I hope you enjoyed this sort of off-cycle thing. We'll do the same thing with VibeOff next week. I'll try to ask almost as hard of questions.

Vaibhav (55:49.837)
Do as hard as you want. I think it's honestly the most fun conversation. I think the disagreements are the most interesting and fun conversations we have, to be honest. Taz versus spaces.

Dex (55:58.584)
That's why people watch the show, right? To watch us argue over how the code should look. Yeah. Alright, y'all. This was great. Thanks, dude.

Vaibhav (56:09.368)
Sounds good.
