## Overview

A candid conversation about Dex's path to founding HumanLayer:

- **Physics to CS**: Starting with half a CS minor and learning Scheme
- **Sprout Social**: Bug squashing duty and building a startup within a startup
- **Developer tooling passion**: From SRE aspirations to packaging and delivery systems at Replicated
- **The pivot to AI**: From Metalytics (SQL data warehouse agents) to meeting Vaibhav at AI Tinkerers Seattle
- **Founding HumanLayer**: Building tools for coding agents to solve hard problems

## Key Takeaways

- The best class isn't Rust - it's Scheme (hot take)
- If you know the thing you want to do, just go do it - don't engineer a complex path
- The most impactful engineers are often those improving developer experience
- Building a startup within a startup: no equity, but also no risk
