Hello First Name,


This week's 🦄 ai that works session was all about "Interruptible Agents"! We explored how to build agents that users can guide, correct, and collaborate with in real-time.

The full recording, code, and diagrams from the session are now available on GitHub:

We covered why this is such a game-changer for UX. Here's a super quick recap:

From Black Box to Collaborator: Most agents today are "fire-and-forget"—you give them a task, and you wait. Interruptible agents let the user jump in, change direction, or provide feedback mid-task. This creates a much more interactive and flexible experience, turning the AI into a true partner.

Architecture Matters (Threading vs. Loop): Building this isn't magic. We dove into two main architectures: a simpler main loop that checks for user input between steps, and a more complex multi-threaded model that allows for true simultaneous operation. The choice depends entirely on your application's needs for responsiveness and complexity.

If you remember one thing from this session:
Don't use a framework. The nuances that you build by choosing an architecture is what gives your agent its identity. Own your own identity.

We also had a fascinating session last week on "Context Engineering Lessons from Manus"! You can find the recording (https://youtu.be/OaUOHEHtlOU) and all materials on the Github!

Our next session on August 26th is going to get a little weird. We'll be showing off a bunch of ways you can use Claude Code as a generic agent to handle non-coding tasks.
