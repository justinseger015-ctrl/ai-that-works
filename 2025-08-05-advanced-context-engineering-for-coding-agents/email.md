Hello First Name,

This week's 🦄 ai that works session was on "Advanced Context Engineering for Coding Agents"!



The full recording, code, and diagrams from the session are now available on GitHub and YouTube:

We covered a ton on how to get the most out of coding agents. Here are 5 key takeaways you can apply today:

Use sub-agents for complex tasks: Instead of one monolithic prompt, decompose the problem. Use specialized prompts for sub-tasks like planning, identifying relevant files, and then generating the code.
Use intentional compaction: Actively manage and shrink your context to keep the agent focused on what's most important.
Align language and naming: Use consistent naming conventions across your codebase to make it easier for the AI to understand the relationships between different parts.
Review the agent's plan: Before it writes code, review the research and plan the agent creates to ensure it's on the right track.
Practice exploratory coding: Work alongside your agent to build your own intuition and spot where the AI excels and where it needs guidance.


If you remember one thing from this session:
Context engineering isn't just about cramming more stuff into the prompt; it's a deliberate practice of structuring, compacting, and aligning information to make your AI agent a more effective partner.

Our next session on August 12th will be all about "Decoding Context Engineering Lessons from Manus". We'll dive deep into their recent paper on KV Cache, hot-swapping tools, and other advanced techniques to get the most out of today's LLMs.
