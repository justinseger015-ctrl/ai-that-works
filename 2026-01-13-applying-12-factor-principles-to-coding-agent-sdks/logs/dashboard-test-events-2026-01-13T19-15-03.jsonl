Only 1 out of 5 orders has been delivered - this suggests potential bottlenecks in the delivery pipeline\n2. 2 pending orders need attention - 40% of orders are still pending\n3. Low driver utilization at 33.3% - only 1 out of 4 drivers is busy (25% busy), but 2 are available\n4. Average order value of ~$30 is decent\n5. With 2 available drivers and 2 pending orders, there's capacity to handle the pending orders\n\nRecommendations:\n- Investigate why orders are stuck in pending/confirmed/preparing stages\n- Consider reducing driver count or increasing order volume to improve utilization\n- Focus on moving pending orders through the pipeline\n- Monitor delivery times to ensure customer satisfaction\n\nAlerts/Issues:\n- 40% of orders are pending - this is high\n- Low driver utilization (33.3%)\n- Only 20% of orders delivered (1 out of 5)\n- 4 out of 5 orders are in various stages but not delivered\n\nLet me structure this in a friendly, conversational way.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":765,"cache_read_input_tokens":15287,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":765,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"85925563-4846-44d5-ab3b-f4ab4c7083bc","uuid":"4ef558be-9790-4cd8-9419-f3e8e288ccd3"}
