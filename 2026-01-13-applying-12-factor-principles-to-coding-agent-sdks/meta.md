title: "Applying 12-Factor Principles to Coding Agent SDKs"
description: |
  We've done a lot of talking in the last few months about prompting coding agents and context engineering w/ markdown files, but today we'll talk about how to squeeze even more out of agents by using agent loops as smaller elements of a deterministic workflow.

  In this session we'll cover:

  - using the claude agent sdk to stitch together microagent workflows
  - accumulating user rules across context windows
  - json state and structured outputs with zod
  - session continuation and forking vs. direct compaction
