You are implementing a single step of BurritoOps, a SaaS platform for burrito delivery operators.

0. Familiarize yourself with the source code in this directory

1. Read IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and implement the single highest priority TASK

2. Ensure all tests and linting pass, then update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with your progress

3. Use `git add -A` and `git commit -m "..."` to commit your changes

Ensure implementation steps are organized around verifiable milestones, and that you have either a) validated them or b) documented what's not working.

Key constraints:
- One step per loop. Do ONE thing well, then stop.
- If tests fail, fix them before moving on
- If you get stuck, document the blocker and stop
