      "description": "Prompting used to be an engineering problem. Write the right string, tweak it until the model behaves, ship it behind the scenes.\n\nThat breaks the moment real users show up. Customers don't think in prompts — they think in goals. They want to explain what they're trying to accomplish, not debug a magic sentence.\n\nSo prompting is moving into the product. Interfaces matter. Structure matters. Guardrails and feedback matter. The real work now isn't prompt cleverness — it's building systems that let people express intent in a way software can actually understand and trust.\n",

They also touch on the integration of web search functionalities and the evaluation of tool effectiveness, providing a comprehensive overview of the development process and the underlying principles of Agentic RAG systems. In this conversation, Vaibhav Gupta and Dex discuss the intricacies of building dynamic AI systems, focusing on tool implementation, user interface optimization, and model performance. They explore the importance of reinforcement learning in training models, the challenges of debugging AI systems, and the significance of writing code to enhance understanding and efficiency in AI development. The dialogue emphasizes the balance between different AI approaches and the necessity of real use cases in building effective solutions.\n",

Starting from a GitHub issue that had been open since March, they showcase a systematic workflow: specification refinement, codebase research, implementation planning, and phased execution. Using Claude and specialized coding agents, they navigate a 400,000+ line codebase, implementing timeout configurations for HTTP clients including connection timeouts, request timeouts, idle timeouts, and time-to-first-token for streaming responses. The session highlights key practices like context engineering, frequent plan validation, breaking complex features into testable phases, and the importance of reading AI-generated code. In under 3 hours of live coding, they achieve what would typically take 1-2 days of engineering time, successfully implementing parsing, validation, error handling, and Python integration tests.\n",
