  "body": "Hello First Name,\n\nThis weeks \ud83e\udd84 ai that works session was on \"Email is All You Need: Building Production Email Agents\"!\n\nThe full recording, code, and diagrams from the session are now available on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/hellovai/ai-that-works\n\nWe covered a lot on building production-ready email workflow engines with LLMs. Here's a super quick recap:\n\n**Email as the Universal API**: Email isn't just for communication\u2014it's where business data already lives and where people naturally want to delegate tasks. With proper infrastructure, you can treat emails like API calls, enabling async workflows that are more robust than traditional chat interfaces.\n\n**The Real Challenge is Infrastructure, Not AI**: The hardest part isn't the LLM processing\u2014it's getting clean, structured email data. Most solutions dump raw email blobs into S3, but you need proper webhook systems, attachment handling, and threading support to build reliable agents.\n\n**Async Workflows Require Careful State Management**: Email agents must handle cancellations, corrections, and race conditions. This means building queue systems with proper concurrency controls, transactional writes, and verification steps to ensure your agent doesn't send conflicting responses or take contradictory actions.\n\nIf you remember one thing from this session:\nEmail agents force you to build truly async, stateful systems from day one\u2014and that constraint actually makes them more robust than typical chat-based agents that own their UI.\n\nOur next session on Tuesday will be a live coding session on \"Vibes are all you need\" \u2013 building features with coding agents and exploring system design trade-offs in real-time.\n\nIf you have any questions, reply to this email or ask on Discord: https://www.boundaryml.com/discord. We read every message! Happy coding \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\n\nVaibhav & Dex",
