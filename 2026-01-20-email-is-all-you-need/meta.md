title: "Email is All You Need"
description: |
  Email is about as adversarial as inputs get: malformed HTML, inconsistent templates, human writing, forwarded junk, zero standards. And yet entire business workflows depend on it.

  This week we're digging into what it takes to build a real email workflow engine where LLMs aren't demos, but are part of production infrastructure.

  We'll cover:

  - Handling long-tail edge cases and weird inbox behavior
  - Validating and correcting extractions before they break downstream systems
  - Maintaining accuracy across thousands of formats and senders
