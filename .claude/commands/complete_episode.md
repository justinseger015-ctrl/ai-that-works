# Complete Episode Command

This command updates episode documentation and writes an email after completing a live session.

## Overview
Update the just-completed episode README and meta.md with YouTube link, thumbnail, and summary and update the main README with episode details. Then write an email.md file for the episode.

## Steps

1. **Check current date** - Use bash to verify today's date, run `bash(ls .)` to see the top level of folder structure here

2. **Get the Youtube Link for the just-completed recording**
   - Run the script: 
   ```bash
   cd 2026-02-17-automating-aitw
   uv run python src/youtube/get_videos.py
   ```
   - The script will print the unicorn video with the highest episode number (format: "title: url")
   - Parse the output to extract the title and URL
   - Display the video title and link to the user in a clear format
   - Ask the user: "Is this the correct podcast recording video? (yes/no)"
   - If yes: save that URL and description to use for the rest of the command
   - If no: ask the user to provide the correct YouTube URL and the episode description manually and use them instead

3. **Get the Folder for the Just Completed Episode**
   - Each episode has a folder in the repo with the date followed by the title (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD-kebab-case-episode-title`)
   - Ask the user to choose from the most recent 5. 
   - Give the user an option to provide their own if they do not want to select one of the options presented, but ensure it exists in the repo.

**STOP and ask the user UNTIL YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE DATA POINTS**

3. **Update completed episode meta.md**:
   - Read at least 3 other past episode meta.mds to understand the format
   - update the github link and youtube urls

4. **Update episode-specific README**:
   - Read `2025-07-08-context-engineering/README.md` for example
   - **IMPORTANT**: Add YouTube thumbnail using this exact format (see ):
     ```markdown
     [![Episode Title](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID)
     ```
     Extract the VIDEO_ID from the YouTube URL (the part after v= or youtu.be/)
   - Leave whiteboards and links sections blank for manual addition
   - Navigate to the just-completed episode folder
   - Update the README with the provided summary

5. **Run the tools to regenerate the JSON manifest**
   - cd tools && bun run readme

6. **Get the Required Information**
   - Get the episode title from the `meta.md` in the directory
   - Get the episode description from the `meta.md` in the directory

**STOP make sure you have the above information before continuing. If you are missing any of them, ask the user for them.**

7. **Verify the Transcript**
Make sure there is a `transcript.txt` file in the directory. If there isn't, ask the user for the transcript.

8. **Generate the Email JSON**
Use the provided information to run the cli:
```bash
   cd 2026-02-17-automating-aitw
   uv run python src/email/generate_email.py --title <provided episode title> --description <provided description> --transcript <path to transcript> --output <path to episode directory>
```

9. **Convert to a email.md**
Convert the outputted json to an `email.md`

10. **Read Context**
   - List all email.md files: `*/email.md`
   - Read at least 3 recent email.md files to understand the tone, structure, and style
   - Read the README.md from the target episode directory to understand the content

11. **Analyze Email Structure**
Emails typically follow this format:
- **Greeting**: "Hello First Name,"
- **Opening**: Reference to "This week's 🦄 ai that works session" with the topic
- **Links**: GitHub repo link and YouTube video link
- **Key Takeaways**: 3-5 numbered or bulleted actionable insights
- **Memorable Quote**: "If you remember one thing from this session:" or "key takeaway" or something similar as a section
- **Next Session**: Information about tomorrow's session with Luma link (this email gets sent out the day before another session)
- **Call to Action**: Discord link, questions invitation
- **Sign-off**: "Happy coding 🧑‍💻" followed by "Vaibhav & Dex" or similar

12. **Humanize the Email**
These emails often come sound like AI slop. Rewrite the email, applying the following rules to make it sound more human-like:
   1. Remove any repetitive "It's not X, it's Y" or an overreliance on em-dashes. Humans don't write like that.
   2. Vary sentence length.
   3. Replace abstract concepts with concrete examples. Push the concepts to include specific "for example" moments that readers can immediately picture. Example before this rule: "Email agents must handle cancellations, corrections, and race conditions." Example after this rule: "when a user sends a follow-up saying 'actually no, I have an onsite' five seconds after their first email, the system needs to handle that gracefully."
   4. Convert descriptions into actionable implications. Don't just explain what something is. Show what you can do with it. Example before this rule: "Email isn't just for communication—it's where business data already lives..." Example after this rule: "You should be able to forward a vendor email to create a task, or have a customer inquiry automatically update your CRM."
   5. Make call to actions specific with direct links. Generated emails frequently have vague CTAs ("check it out", "learn more"). Always add the specific link, date, or next step so the reader doesn't have to hunt for it.


## Email Notes
- Keep the tone conversational but informative
- Focus on actionable takeaways readers can apply immediately
- The "If you remember one thing" should be the most important concept
- Links should use the actual GitHub structure: `https://github.com/hellovai/ai-that-works/tree/main/[EPISODE-DIR]`

## Important Notes
- Use TodoWrite to track progress through these steps
- Think deeply about the structure and format before making changes
- Verify all information is present before proceeding with updates
- Maintain consistency with existing episode documentation format
- The YouTube thumbnail is REQUIRED - reference 2025-07-08-context-engineering/README.md as a working example
