      <description><![CDATA[On #17 we talked about advanced context engineering workflows for using Claude code to work in complex codebases. This week, we're gonna get a little weird with it, and show off a bunch of ways you can use Claude Code as a generic agent to handle non-coding tasks. We'll learn things like: Skipping the MCP and having claude write its own scripts to interact with external systems, Creating internal knowledge graphs with markdown files, How to blend agentic retrieval and search with deterministic context packing

      <title><![CDATA[S02E02 – Policy to Prompt: Evaluating w/ the Enron Emails Dataset]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[One of the most common problems in AI engineering is looking at a set of policies/rules and evaluating evidence to determine if the rules were followed. In this session we'll explore turning policies into prompts and pipelines to evaluate which emails in the massive Enron email dataset violated SEC and Sarbanes-Oxley regulations.
