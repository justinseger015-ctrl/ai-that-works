"title": "Agentic RAG + Context Engineering"
"description": "RAG vs. Agentic RAG is the hot new debate at the forefront of AI Engineering. On this week's episode we'll dive deep on the differences, why it matters, and cut through the buzzword hype with hands-on whiteboarding and live working code. We'll talk about the tradeoffs between deterministic retrieval and curated context engineering vs. the benefits of letting models assemble their context with tools."
