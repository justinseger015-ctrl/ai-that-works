Hello First Name,

This weeks 🦄  ai that works session was on "Claude for non-code tasks"! 



The full recording and code from the session are now available on GitHub:

We explored how to use LLMs for practical, everyday tasks without writing complex software. Here’s the key anecdote:

We explored how to use LLMs for practical, everyday tasks without writing complex software. Here's an example anecdote:

Instead of building a full-blown personal CRM, what if you just used a simple Markdown file? We showed how you can maintain a `crm.md` file, dump your notes and interactions into it, and then use Claude as an intelligent assistant to query and update it. You can ask questions like "Who did I talk to about vector databases last week?" or "Summarize my last conversation with Jane from Acme Corp." This is a powerful workflow that requires zero database setup.

This illustrates two big ideas:
1.  Markdown as a Database: For many tasks, a structured text file is a perfectly good—and much simpler—database.
2.  Context Engineering over Code: The magic isn't in writing a new application, but in engineering the context (the prompt and the .md file) to make the LLM a useful tool in your existing workflow.

If you remember one thing from this session:
LLMs are a new type of software. The key to success here is:
Choose problems that have more give (e.g. creating release notes)
Use LLMs to do V1 of the pipeline with vibes (or vaib's)
As you find parts of the pipeline need more rigidity / consistency, apply more software engineering.
DON'T OPTIMIZE FROM DAY 1! Learn. Adapt. Ship.

Last week we had a great session on "Interruptible agents" and how to design long-running agents you can steer. The recording is on Github & Youtube.

Our next session on September 2nd will be about building your own high-quality voice agents using supervisor-threaded systems. We'll ship real working code you can use right away.
